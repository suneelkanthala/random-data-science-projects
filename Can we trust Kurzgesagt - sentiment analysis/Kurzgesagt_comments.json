Physical death is not mental death. You will possess many different material bodies via reincarnation. In fact, you already have. Countless physical lives already lie behind you. Each body dies, but you go on. Every soul is an infinite frequency domain. A frequency domain can do something remarkable. Via the inverse Fourier Transform, it can create spacetime representations of frequency functions. In other words, a soul – simply by thinking mathematically and converting frequency functions into equivalent spacetime functions – can create whole “physical” worlds in its mind. The so-called material world doesn’t exist as anything other than an inverse Fourier Transform. In your dreams, you create your own private world and populate it with anything you like. There are no laws, other than those of Fourier mathematics. You can do whatever you like in your dreams, make anything you like, meet anyone you like, simulate anyone you like. There are no objective laws of space and time, no objective causal laws. You can do anything. You can fly, walk through walls, shrink yourself and expand yourself, make yourself invisible. You name it, you can do it. Your dreams are “proof of concept”. They show that minds – frequency domains – can generate the illusion of physicality. So, why shouldn’t “actual” physicality be a mentally-generated illusion too?\n\n***\n\nPhysicality is inside space and time. Frequency is outside space and time. If you exist as a unitary frequency domain outside space and time then you do not belong to the material world, hence you cannot die in material terms. You really are an eternal being. You can never escape from your existence. You are as old as existence itself, and existence is eternal. You have always existed. You have been with the universe through every step. In your mind is the history of everything that has ever been in the current Cosmic Age. Every secret of the universe is stored in your mind. You yourself have the answers to everything – if you did but know it. The universe consists of nothing but infinite frequency domains – souls! This collection of souls can do something astounding. Rather than always dream individually in complete isolation, the souls can also dream collectively. This is what produces the objective, waking world that we all share. The waking world is an objective, collective dreamworld, while the sleeping world is a subjective, individual dreamworld. That’s the only difference. Both obey Fourier mathematics. When we go to sleep, we leave the public reality and enter the private reality. When we awake, we leave the private reality and re-enter the public reality. We are always dreaming, individually or collectively. When we “die”, our current body leaves the collective dreamworld permanently, and we can only re-enter the collective dreamworld by being reborn via reincarnation. In other words, reincarnation is about the periodic reinsertion of ourselves into the collective dream, via the acquisition of new “dream bodies”.\n\nEach mind can generate its own private “material” worlds in its own individual dreams, but all of the minds working together can also generate a public material world in their collective dream. This public material world of the collective dream is extremely different from the private material world of private dreams. It has fixed laws of spacetime, of mass and energy, of gravity, and so on. In other words, the public material world is the place of objective laws of science. No human mind can overturn these public laws. They are binding on everyone. Every other mind resists you in the public world, whereas no mind resists you in your private world. That’s what differentiates these worlds and gives them their distinctive character. In your private dreamworld, your will is the only will present. In the public dreamworld, all wills are present ... you are up against the will of every other living monad. Your will is being resisted. The Freudian Id acts as though it’s the only will (i.e. it lives in a fantasy world). The Freudian Superego is acutely aware of all other wills (i.e. it lives in a moral world). The Freudian Ego mediates between the Id and Superego via the reality principle (i.e. it lives in the real world). The private material world of individual dreams is based on internally generated coordinates. Everything takes place within the individual soul and has no connection with any other soul. A soul in these conditions is “windowless”. It’s hermetically sealed. The public material world of the collective dream is based on collectively generated Cartesian coordinates. Every monad is assigned unique coordinates in this collective Cartesian arena, this perfect coordinate grid. When all of the minds together perform their usual inverse Fourier transforms – but now directed at a collective mathematical arena rather than individual mathematical arena – they thereby generate what we know as the material world, which science then foolishly concludes is independent of us, rather than created by all of our minds working together. The “matter” that scientists believe in is simply the collective, objective product of minds working in mathematical concert. It has no reality in the absence of minds, contrary to what scientists claim. Scientists are mathematically and philosophically illiterate, which is why they are materialists rather than idealists. Has any scientist ever mathematically explained dreams and how dream worlds can so closely resemble the “real” world? Clearly, dreams must be using the same basic mathematical techniques, but without generating any objective “matter”. The collective inverse Fourier Transform processing of infinite minds is in fact none other than the basis of quantum mechanics! All of the minds together calculate the evolution of the cosmic wavefunction that generates our collective physical reality.﻿"}

Why should the obvious conclusion be avoided? The \"real\" world is a dream world — a construct of mental activity — with one quintessential quality that makes it radically different from our normal dreams: it is a COLLECTIVE dreamscape, not singular. All the minds in the universe contribute to this dream. It's a public, not a private dream. We can \"wake up\" from our private dreams, but we can't wake up from the public dream because we are not in control of it, and nor is anyone else, we can, however, die, and then we do leave the dream. However, reincarnation (or shall we call it \"periodic re-insertion into the collective dream\") throws us back in. Reincarnation is nothing more than \"waking up\" but in a brand new body. Not even death affords an escape from the dream! To quote The Eagles' famous song Hotel California, \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\"\nThere is only one exit from the dream: Gnosis (enlightenment). When you finally grasp that your existence has been one long dream, both public and private (waking and sleeping, across many different bodies and lifetimes), you transcend the dream. You become a Dream Master, a God. Like Neo in The Matrix, you can then do whatever you like in the public dream: you have \"super powers\" — in fact, Divine powers. You can choose to stay within the dream, but, to Gods, the normal dream rapidly loses its attraction. The Gods can do something else, they can construct a higher dream, reserved for the highest minds, the Gods can build heaven, and from heaven they can look  in whenever they like on the lower dream: our world. People imagine that they go to such a heaven when they die, they don't. They are reincarnated back into the normal world and they will never get out until they have understood the true nature of reality.\nOne might say that there are only two public dream domains — heaven and hell — and we, sadly, are in hell!\nSouls are not involved in a test of good versus evil, and are not overseen by a supreme arbiter of morality. Wether it be a morally perfect \"God\" or some cosmic force called \"karma\" that ensures that good deeds are rewarded and bad deeds punished. There is no such God and no such karma. Just about the greatest lie of existence is that it's inherently connected with morality. Morality perse has nothing to do with anything. There is no such thing as morality if it is to be understood as an infallible, absolute set of criteria of good and evil. Morality is always about opinions, beliefs, customs, biases and self-interest. \"Morality\" is always a weapon wielded by one group against another out of pure self-interest, hence has nothing to do with what morality is supposed to be (I.e., entirely beyond self-interest). \nThe true test of existence is that of intelligence versus stupidity; knowledge versus ignorance. Heaven is full of the smartest people in the universe, not the nicest or most faithful or obedient or sanctimonious or best at kneeling and groveling, or the best at putting on a show of meekness, mildness and rectitude. Life is a cosmic IQ test and the only people who get \"saved\" are the geniuses! Geniuses are the true Elect, the only people who will get into heaven are the ones who are smart enough to build it!﻿"}

When we awaken, we re-enter “reality” – the public space.\n\nWe are always dreaming, except sometimes we are dreaming singly and at the other times we are dreaming collectively.\n\nThe material world is not there as anything other than a shared product of the contents of our minds. It’s wholly dependent on mind and has no independent reality. It’s a “scientific” arena because it operates according to the single language that all monads understand: mathematics.\n\nThe mathematics that applies to the shared universe are extremely rigid, predictable and objective. However, when we dream privately, we are no longer subject to these objective rules, which is why space, time and causality vanish in our dreams. Our attention directs where we go next in a dream – not our physical senses and physical bodies (which are deactivated when we are dreaming).\n\nWhy do humans privately dream at all? What’s the point of private dreaming? Well, for one thing, it’s the ultimate simulator. We can have hyper-realistic dreams that simulate the most awful, and also the most pleasurable, things. We can rehearse public life in our private dreams. Also, it’s the ultimate downtime. We can leave all the worries, pressures and frustrations of the shared environment behind. Above all, it’s where we can experience our numinous Higher Self, albeit through the filter of the unconscious.\n\nIf you want to know what death is like, well, you already know! In death, you simply enter an enhanced dream state. Part of that dream state is something very real and very serious: it concerns how you negotiate your reincarnation. Most people have no idea what’s going on, so are simply swept along by the “dream current”, and end up in any old body. Those who have been correctly trained, know exactly what’s happening and can exercise immense mathematical control over the process ... and insert themselves into exactly the body and life they want.﻿"}

That immediately means that you must be in the mathematical game. If you cannot provide a precise definition and formula then you must humbly admit that you simply don’t know, and stop pretending to gullible people that you do. We are of course addressing all of the “gurus” and “prophets” of the world, trying to sucker vulnerable minds into their toxic, self-serving belief systems (invariably designed to make them rich and powerful). With Illuminism, you are not required to believe anything at all. What we say is either rational or irrational. If it’s irrational, it’s junk. If it’s rational – by which we mean it reflects eternal truths of reason – then it’s incontestable, infallible and constitutes absolute knowledge. Only reason, when applied strictly to the eternal truths of reason, never errs, never lies, never deceives. Only ontological mathematics offers certainty. That’s a fact. Either you accept ontological mathematics as the answer to everything, with all that this implies, or you turn to faith, mysticism, irrationalism, accident, chance, randomness, miracles, magic and mystery. Well, what’s it to be? Are you rational or not?\n\nInformation\n\nTo all the “gurus” who imagine they know what existence is, we ask, What is existence made of?; What is life made of?; What is mind made of?; What is free will made of?; What is a thought made of?; What is a feeling made of?; What is an intuition made of?; What is a sensation made of?; What is desire made of?; What is will made of?; What is love made of?; What is the unconscious made of?; What is consciousness made of? After all, they must be made of something. Even fantasies, hallucination, errors, fallacies, beliefs and opinions are made of something. Everything is made of something. What is that something? That’s the fundamental question of existence. There can be only one answer: everything is made of mathematical sinusoids, the perfect carriers of information that give rise to a universe of information. There is not a single thing in the universe that is not concerned with information. It doesn’t have to be accurate or true information, but it certainly has to be information.\n\nAll of your feelings, thoughts, dreams, aspirations, desires, fears, hopes, prayers, loves and hates are all information. There are those who say that mathematics destroys the “poetry” of life. Yet, of course, poetry is also nothing but information! It’s mathematics that creates poetry. Mathematics destroys nothing. Mathematics makes everything possible. Given time, it will even make you God.﻿"}

Someone had to be them.\n \nYou had to be lower animals to be a human now. You lived as all the different animals in your evolutionary line. You lived through millions of years, and millions of lives and deaths to get where you are now. That's what Darwin's book means.\n \nIn addition to the fossil evidence, the genetic code proves that all animals, including us, evolved from bacteria over the last 700 million years on earth.\n \nIn other words, you were a microbe, an insect, a fish, a dinosaur, an ape...\n \nWhen all of the evidence (100%) says something happened, and there is no evidence (zero) that anything else could have happened, it is the truth beyond a reasonable doubt to honest, rational people.\n \nWe have come a very, very long way, but we have a little further to go. The next and last step in our evolution is learning and accepting the truth of life, and this includes acknowledging our true past.\n \nYou will die physically, but you will be born into a new physical body. Being born happens, or you would not be here now. You were born into this life. It is what we know happens. There is no evidence anything else happens. True or false?\n \nThe \"you only live once\" theory: Many people say that they do not believe in reincarnation; they believe when you die, you're dead. What about fish, clams, horses, bears, flies? People that say you only live once are saying some souls get to live just one life as a worm, and that is it for all of eternity.\n \nOther people believe you are judged by a god after you die. Is the worm judged?\n\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another. Albert Einstein\n \nLike energy, consciousness cannot be created or destroyed.\n \nThis revelation will change your life.

It is the ultimate truth of life; the truth that will transform mankind and the world.\n \n\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" F(AB) = -F(BA)\n\nPeople do not realize what Isaac Newton's third law of motion really means.\n \nEverything is balanced. Everything physical (matter/energy) goes back and forth in balanced circles, cycles, or the equivalent.

Reason being anyone that has seen the original video and tried to go back to it would still see the same content AND they'd learn about the new? I LOVE the fact that you've owned up to the fact that you're not proud of something that you've done and that you're working to fix that. That is a huge step, especially in this era. However just deleting the video COULD be  seen as trying to hide your mistakes. Errors will always happen and taking steps to correct them is a natural part of the scientific process, however simply deleting them is somewhat like pretending it didn't happen. I know that is by no means the case especially with a video like this one, however, I could see some people taking it that way. \n\nLeaving incorrect, or poorly researched ideas out there is fine (in my opinion) IFF there steps are taken to inform people of the errors that were made. A giant red stamp on the video or an extra intro that says something like \"Ooops, this wasn't our best work and this isn't the best representation of research in the field. We published this hastily a while back, please see our new video here that has a more balanced view and is better representative of the work in the field\". \n\nA bad idea can still be the spark that lights a new, good idea. So long as the bad idea gets burnt away by the flame of the new. Which admittedly can be a dangerous if not handled responsibly, which I 100% think this channel is capable of doing.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you do next!﻿"}

I'd hate to see it taken down permanently because my roommate is expected home from alcohol rehab sometime in the next few days. Addiction has hit my town like a bomb. Here in Pittsfield local group \"Smash the Stigma\" is attempting to campaign for governments treating addiction as an illness and to help \"smash the stigma\" attached to addicts. \n\nI want to tell you about some cases I personally witnessed parts of that hardened my resolve to try and protect my community. \n\nI met Danny when he was rooming up the street at the home of an elderly friend of mine named Ginger. I go over to Ginger's in the summer and spend a few minutes hanging out with her now and again to keep her company. I noticed Danny because he was skin and bone and his nails were an unhealthy yellow and very brittle. He refused to consume anything other than beer. He wouldn't eat, go to the hospital, or actively try to harm himself. He took great joy from a cat Ginger temporarily took care of while its owner was away and in Ginger's companion dog Buddy. My roommate and I repeatedly attempted to get Danny to eat and eventually convinced him to consume protein shakes from the local pharmacy. But it was too little too late. His body had already taken too much of a pounding from consuming nothing but beer. He was found sitting in Ginger's bathroom on the toilet, praying. Danny was a profoundly depressed man, who believed he didn't deserve help when everyone deserves to be well regardless of who they are , what they did in the past, or where they came from. Looking back I don't believe Danny was able to be saved, his desire to die was too strong, but I would have been very upset with myself for not trying to help him. And regardless of what he may have thought of himself, he is missed.\n\nPete has been living on the streets of Pittsfield for 8 years, ever since he hopped on the bus from Lee to here one day and never looked back. He's an alcoholic with a history of heart problems and a gracious mentality. Last summer his condition appeared to be improving, he had a room to stay in and had been sober for a few months. I thought I wouldn't have to worry about his welfare anymore. I was wrong. His son, also an addict, was found dead in a nearby park with the needle still in his hand. Opiates, probably fentynal (sp?). Pete lost it. He ended up back on the street and his drinking became so bad he is now physiologically dependant on alcohol. He will have a seizure if he stops drinking. But there's only one shelter in town with \"wet beds.\" So very often he has to go to the hospital at night instead. He's become so impaired that he soils himself. But at least when I tell him he needs a hospital he believes me, even though the alcoholic daze, and asks me to phone 911 for him. I give him treats from my garden and buy him the occasional bag of chocolate covered nuts and vitamin water. I won't give him money because I refuse to possibly buy the drink that kills him. \n\nI first met Pete when he was having heatstroke a little ways up the sidewalk from the local dollar store. I bought him a great big bottle of cold water and a package of wash cloths to clean his head. He'd lost most of his hair, and his head was raw from sunburn. To this day I keep an eye on his corner as I pass by to make sure he's alright, but he seems to have a place to stay in weather emergencies so I know he's smart enough not to freeze to death. The cold winters of the Berkshires are nothing to poke fun at, and hypothermia is no fun at all. I've repeatedly told Pete that I do NOT want to find out he was found dead in a ditch somewhere. I also repeatedly told him that I don't want authorities to find him frozen to death and buried in snow. \n\nPeople like Pete and Danny make me angry at what addiction has done to my community. While I believe addicts need medical care not jail time, I believe dealers need to be beaten and locked in a dark cold cage with no hope of getting out, ever. They suck the life out of this community in order to survive. And alcohol... is a monster.﻿"}

My Grandfather smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day.  Before my Grandmother passed away, he would only smoke 3-4 cigarettes a day.  (Im not saying it was good, but better)  I know cigarettes are not a huge deal compared to other drug addictions, but at his age and lack of physical activity, it was doing great damage.  \nFor years I told him about how unhealthy they we're for his health and that he should stop or he could develop serious problems.  But I never went any further than that.  After seeing your Addiction video and how being around people can help, we started going out to do things together.  We would go out for ice cream, dinner, or just to get some fresh air.  We would sit and talk for hours about his time as a police officer and all the crazy and funny stories his long career brought him.  After a few weeks, he stopped smoking!  His breathing got better and we both got some much needed exercise.  \nI like to think that your video, regardless of your unhappiness toward it, helped to save my Grandfather's life.  I thank you and hope to see more of your amazing videos in the near future.﻿"}

You said it took over a year and a half to complete, and it really changed me. For the most part, I'm an average guy studying in college, but when I saw your video, I realized that despite having good friends here, I felt lonely. And it showed, I don't think I've become a better person since coming here, and now I know why, I just feel hostile because I'm lonely. To never forget what I learned while watching, I bought a poster and kept it over my desk. Everytime I see it, it reminds me to appreciate the friends I have here and know that everyone feels the same way as I do sometimes, and it's up to me to overcome myself and be happy. I worry less about making socially acceptable decisions now, and just be myself when I'm around others and I try to treat everyone like a friend. Thank you for encouraging me to become a better person.﻿"}

Basically you are just ANOTHER pathetic Youtube channel that wants to generate views with common, basic scientific facts, no engaged scientists give a damn about. You are exactly the same as the other 1000 Youtube channels that are talking about facts. Facts that will impact nothing but your numbers. So thank you for nothing and thank you for contributing to the global warming by living your lives the way you do. Your actions will only fasten the process of our extinction, instead of slowing it down. Give the people informations about slowing down our all extinction, how about that? Nutrition, lifestyles, laws, so many things need to change in order to not go extinct the next century. Instead of doing so, you are wasting ressources on making a video about loneliness. Whoever takes this channel seriously, should not be taken seriously. Thank you for reading and take action against global warming everybody! The future life on this planet depends on us all!﻿"}

However, this particular vid has me concerned that in the near future you're going to pump out more politically correct, poorly researched, talking points for the purposes of virtue signaling. That's part of the problem with corporate sponsors....they tend to want you to toe the line and the minute you say anything that they don't like they could pull funding. So if you're being pressured by sponsors, youtube, or whomever to throw away your rational mind and credibility for the sake of virtue signaling talking points then I am trully sorry. But I get it, this channel pays the bills for quite a few folks. Maybe the solution is to stay away from subjects where you're required to spew anti-rational nonsense such as in the case of global warming and such. Take care!﻿"}

But I must say I'm surprised that you acknowledged that you pushed an agenda, and even owned up to your mistakes. I must say I'm very impressed, and I apologise for my aforementioned judgement. \n\nRegardless of your politics, I believe your channel is very informative and really does a good job at presenting scientific theories, oddities, or problems in our world. And I do greatly enjoy your scientific content. However I do think that the quality of your videos drops when it comes to opinion pieces. But as you said, they're opinion pieces and aren't a presentation of undeniable facts. However I think jumping from cold hard facts to opinion pieces can lead people, such as myself previously, to believe that you're pushing opinions as if they were fact. \n\nOverall, I'm sorry I misjudged you lot. You clearly put a lot of work into your videos, and I guess its not entirely fair to write off your channel when you make a few mistakes. You've regained an old supporter in me.﻿"}

On another note, i often find myself wondering why the videos are so sparse, but i never really questioned how long it could take to do the research and make sure its accurate, as i do it without thinking half the time. I am glad you guys are putting in all the effort and are correcting your past inaccuracies, even if i didnt see any.

Anybody with a brain can look out and see it's flat...😋\nYour immigration video only shows you have some shit ideas. Help those people improve their own countries. Why the fuck do you think it's acceptable for those people to take over the culture of current countries in the EU? Because of compassion? Bullshit. People that make that argument are total shit. And lack the honesty to face the fact that some cultures are complete shit. The Islamic culture for instance. They are perfectly happy subjugating women and killing homosexuals. When you are not smart enough or brave enough to call out these facts, you are a retard. When you cannot see the rapes in Sweden have MASSIVELY increased, you are weak minded. And DESERVE to burn in hell. I don't give a damn about religion. I'm all for anybody practising voodoo if they want. But Islam is a theocracy. And anybody stupid enough to combine religion and law should be condemned. Not only that, but you aren't even smart enough to realize that when you get massive number of young men who were raised to Stone a woman for showing too much ankle and put them in a western culture where women can walk around topless with a g-string, you are going to have problems. Problems that stem EXCLUSIVELY from that shit culture of the young men. Combine that with the distain most Muslims are taught for the \"lower class\" infidels... And you get massive rapes occuring.\nYou are on the left, obviously. So you CANNOT criticize Islam. Otherwise your leftist cult will cry outrage. But I can. Because I don't give a shit what idiots think of me. I have the brains to know you had BETTER criticize the evils of the world. And the way Islam treats women, gays and law is abhorrent to the values of a free and prosperous people. Until they are called out enough, why the hell will they change?

Big surprise, research into vehicle crashes is largely funded by the vehicle production industry. Does that make its information false? Biased? They're both massive, for-profit industries with large government subsidies, but you trust one industry to tell you to wear your seatbelts, yet you dont trust another industry to tell you how to keep yourself and children safe? Okay then, more analogies. The technology industry industry is also a behemoth of creation, with one of the largest markets in America, with $351 billion in total revenue. You believe them when they tell you performance percentages, speed enhancements, etc. Yet, you dont believe and industry of similar size with something much more important: your health? Remember, these are profit driven markets, and making a product that harms your target market is a bad, bad idea indeed. Not to mention the years of trials and struggle simply to pull a treatment to human trials. You understand little of the nature of the industry, and research as a whole. However, if you would like, there are hundreds of reliable, independent funding research studies that also show vaccines are completely safe for the populace. Of course, anything that doesn't fit into your narrative of \"big phurma badd\" is fake news, so why should I even try?﻿"}

It's worth talking about at any rate, especially in the context of this video. I think when most people say “don't talk about politics” what they mean is they don't want political ideology and bias. Journalism, infotainment or any other information source has an obligation to present all of the facts, independently and impartially, objectively with context and balance to opposing viewpoints in a transparent and accountable way. Otherwise, it's not a good information source and shouldn't present itself as one. \nAny issue can be discussed objectively and skeptically including politics, it's just not easy for most people to resist the temptation to influence the audience. The correct orientation is to offer the full and accurate information so that the audience can draw their own conclusions. Every degree to which something deviates from that betrays the trust of the audience.﻿"}

The trick is that you have to admit your bias fully to the public.  \n\nIf you frame your argument as \"coming from a specific political ideology\" and then make a rational argument, you have essentially made a persuasive essay for your cause.  What that means is that an intelligent audience member can respond and debate in a way that's impossible if you frame your essay as \"I tried to be completely objective.\"\n\nFor example, if you start a video by saying \"I'm a moderate socialist\" and then make a comprehensive argument for moderate socialist policies with clear references and sources for different ideas, the audience can engage with it in a much healthier way.  \n\nInstead of being a video that's supposed to be far above the audience in objectivity, and to which their only criticism can be \"it's not objective,\" the video has the same amount of bias as a normal human, and can then be debated by a normal human.\n You'll get a lot more garbage comments if you explicitly state your bias, but the good comments will become much more helpful.\n\nReal objective media is impossible, because the creator is always going to be influenced by internal biases, even if they know the basic fallacies and how to avoid them.  We are just too human.  So instead of aiming for something impossible, I'd rather media centers define and defend concrete positions.  That way, bias stops being something insidious, that's creeping in the subconscious, and becomes something more open and honest.\n\nI would take a video by someone who clearly establishes a belief and makes a good argument for it over someone who attempts to be objective and is influenced by bias without their knowledge.\n\nIf you try to make something objective your biases will stop you, but if you try to make something openly biased they will help you understand your beliefs and yourself.﻿"}

Just like with refugee video they mentioned the drowned boy, going full \"think about the children\" mode that got them big part of heat for that video. And here they are, doing same thing in this very video, precisely at 2:55. If you really cared about the children as you claim you do, Kurzgesagt, you'd mention pedophile rings popping up around western Europe, filled with \"asians\" that hurt, mentally scar children for life and often kill them too. But you mentioned none of those things. Is this because it's too disgusting and frightening to talk about it? Maybe, but it happens and not talking about it only makes it worse. It's definitely politically incorrect to talk about such things and so you bend under the pressure of demonetization and other ostracizes  while covering yourself with blanket of \"those videos are so short, it's impossible to take into account every point and argument!\". No Kurzgesagt, this is conveniently leaving out one side of argument because this thing is so big and significant, a well informed journalists as you claim to be would know about it and talk about it.\nYou are partisan.﻿"}

On top of dealing with the never ending pain that robs us of so much of life, we have to deal with the judgment, condescension, and overt biases from the overwhelming majority of people in society (often including our doctors, friends, and family) who are under-informed on the topic of chronic pain and opioid use. One of the main culprits for the irrational feelings people have about opioids seems to be in large part because of the war on opioids, and the way that it gives permission to marginalize people who live with chronic pain. There are friendly fire casualties in all wars, and the war on opioids is no different. People who live with serious chronic pain kill themselves every day, and not only because of the pain, but because of the pain combined with the hopelessness created by a society that blames us for using what is often the only effective treatment for our pain.\n\nP.S.

However, I do not agree with the decision to take down the immigration video. It's premise was not scientific or rational, it was emotional, and cannot be held in the same light. It used pathos to reach it's audience, because logic is sometimes slow, and even the illusion of debate dignifies the opposition. There are no \"real and profound concerns\" of significance. Morality demands you help your neighbor, and logic demands you benefit your economy. People who were insulted deserved to feel insulted, because their actions and opinions were heinous. Unfounded fear and ignorance does not deserve civilized response. I get the attempt to not polarize even more and serve as a medium for all political ideologies, but sometimes the only way forward is through.

For the sake of even the most basic clarity, what qualifies as a mainstream institution? Academia? The news (if so, which sources and why? If not, why? Keep in mind some news sources lack economic incentives to lie)? Government organizations that create and track information (kind of necessary for the vast majority of statistics)? Independent research institutions outside traditional academia (sometimes untrustworthy but often fairly reliable)? Think tanks (probably best avoided but I felt I should include them)? I'm just saying we (the kurzgesagt audience) should be aware of what a \"mainstream source\" is if you are going to give preferential treatment to other internet creators over the \"mainstream sources\".﻿"}

Why not make the videos longer script wise?\n Your scripts are usually quite highly tight and that's INCREDIBLY rare for 10 minute videos (Most are abysmal in research and focus, barely getting to a point if at all.), but it sounds like you're actively limiting your explanations. Such as mentioning the oversimplification of specific subjects and worrying about them being too long.(Which indicates a lot of hard work put into your scripts for the sake of brevity)\n\nI understand making them too long can certainly be an issue, but for such MASSIVE subjects, surely your works could improve from some more in depth explanations. And I think your audience has a normal attention span so they can handle it (Think VSauce's channels, they have very often 20 minute videos, and there's basically no issue there.) So maybe go for 20 minutes\nAs for the animation, well that's another story. I know how animation can be, I'm an animator myself. And it can be a bit time consuming. So, I suggest maybe bridge out your bigger animation moments for those KEY points in the video and have other parts less intensive? Might help a lot there, as it's a fair compromise.\n\nI'd appreciate a response back, but this is merely a suggestion in sake of more strongly contented videos since you can go much more in depth with twice the time freed. And given how long you work on them, it would make it worth it if you're allowed a bit more freedom. All up to you, you could even poll it if you wanted to.\n\nAnyway, I actually appreciate this video. You made it really quite clear that you valued your audience's respect(even admitting faults in the past) and a dedication to solid research. That's rare these days, but so important. In a field of film analysis and other such fields, you can see how badly it affects their works, while you guys here shine due to the hard work. I think I can trust you guys with what you provide, as you've done well for years.﻿"}

This shows you are growing as a channel. You could really tell with the refugee video that it was seriously rushed, only from one perspective and far too emotional for an informative video. Especially when you didnt take into account that most of them were male, fighting age, not even from Syria and should be considered economic migrants. We still see the repercussions of misinformation about the refugee crisis to this day. People flooding in from Africa for instance. Im glad you now realise that putting in a personal opinion is persuading people to follow your personal morals and that its much better to just give people the information they need and to make up their own mind.﻿"}

Or if not so much the process, then perhaps talk about what they did, what they found interesting, and in some areas where they failed to achieve something that they wanted to. \n\nMuch like in a charity organization, you have an Anual General Meeting or [AGM], you talk about these issues that the organization faced, what went well what didn't go so well and areas on which those organizations could improve. I think that if this channel were to incorporate that sort of methodology to the way they present themselves then that would make them a far more credible source of information, as they are letting in public and indeed professional scrutiny into the mix. \n\nOn saying all of that, my friends, some of which are scientists themselves, swear by this channel. and even use it as a source of reliable information for our friendly debates on several different topics. What this channel does really really well, is put across complicated information in a bite-sized uncomplicated presentation of that information. The breakdown of information into manageable pieces of info is frankly, amazing. \n\nI always look forward to more content from Kurzgesagt.﻿"}

No matter how careful you guys are, we all make mistakes, including experts. Sometimes, we know we know and sometimes we know we do not know. But more often than not, we do not know that we do not know, even if we believe that we know. Albert Einstein had a hard time embracing quantum physics in his lifetime, which does not make it any wronger.\n\n\nBeing scientific is precisely about doubting just anything and always be ready to embrace evidence rather than perspectives, even if that evidence works against what we want to believe. I appreciate the quality of work you guys have done and I definitely agree that the majority of your videos have a very strong support from experts and evidences. These videos are excellent start points for anybody who are interested in the subjects. But, always remember that science is constantly evolving and these videos are not the truths, but at best the contemporary views from the scientific community.\n\n\nIn summary, do not blindly trust just anything. Do your own research and embrace new ideas. The universe is too amazing to not at least try to appreciate its beauty.﻿"}

{"author": "Electric Rain", "cid": "UgxXBBLCgx2iv33WY6R4AaABAg", "time": "1 hour ago", "text": "It's less do with you video content and more to do with the funding and sponsorships. So for example in the overpopulation video (or another similar one), you were sponsored by the Bill and Melinda foundation. If you look into the past history of Bill, he seems awfully interested in eugenics and he isn't all sunshine and roses to me, currently he is in Congo where an outbreak of Ebola started and he is on record for talking a lot about a next 'huge' pandemic. Of course there's no proof he started it but nothing is completely wholesome about him. A lot of your videos have an agenda to shrink the population and move away from organic thinking as though it's the plague when technology realistically should be created to aid and help in natural processes better such as in organic foods. However I like how you are not trying to get information from mainstream sources as they as you know like most institutions are, have ideas which are probably funded by the same people like bill and melinda. \n\n\nYour channel has a huge influence, and it's probably used in schools, so it's up to you really but in the future like you said videos should be based on balanced facts rather than bias, and certainly not influenced thanks to sponsorships, that's no different than an experiment about faulty cars being funded by Toshiba and finding that their cars are the best performing. Your channel graphics are amazing but I really wish people would pay real attention beyond that and really, really listen to the content being pushed because a lot of it parallels to the agenda 2030 thinking and trans humanism movement, which has certainly not been lost on me. \n\n\n\nThe video that certainly got me the most heated was the 'organic' food one as the topic of how it harms the environment was completely left out and the focus was just on humans alone, when the whole point of organic farming IS about helping and coexisting with the environment like humanity has successfully done for millions of years. There is no coincidence how colony collapse disorder and loss of biodiversity increased after the industrial revolution. Talking about harm on humans without realising that humanity and the ecosystem is linked is really dangerous for the environment in the long run.﻿"}

They’ve said YouTube wasn’t a vaild source od information, that it’s full of lies, misinformation, and simplification. And yet it is them who are oversimplifing it. Yes, you shouldn’t trust every video you watch on YouTube, and you should do your own research, but there are also many amazing channels like Kurzgesagt, that I can say have earned my trust for being a quite reliable source, and more importantly, that serve as a fantastic gateway into the world of science, introducing me to many beautiful and fascinating topics, sparking my curiosity to study them further. I can even say that bits of knowledge gained on YouTube helped me score some extra points on my college tests on multiple occasions. So... yes, I think knowledge gained through YouTube can be very valuable, and I want to thank Kurzgesagt for being among those that provide it, and really caring about doing it the right way﻿"}

A major issue with the internet today is how divisive it can be with how it presents information to people. Not to say that this issue can be resolved entirely. But, through the communication and implementation of more powerful tools among small entities, I think it's possible to resolve a lot of the incoherence that takes place around the net. Over time I think we'll see the growing availability of better tools and sources to synthesize information into sophisticated tapestries of knowledge for everyday consumers. In an age where it feels like it's hard to find the \"truth\" about something, Kurzgesagt is committed to the next step of this development. It is very honorable.\nThank you Kursgesagt for your dedication of making top-notch content!! You guys are the best.﻿"}

Moreover, I didn't manage to find methodology or any reference or something that could prove that his statistics that you used in the table \"Death per energy unit generated per year\" is valid. I am personally a nuclear energy supporter too and even have PhD on this topic but I try to never ever give a reference on such researchers as Conca as it will hit my image and everything I say and will say really hard.

Now, several years later it would be easier to get a better and more rational view on the crisis, that actually has not disappeared but bearely raises public attention as it once did. You also would have the chance to use numbers, which have not existed at the peak of the crisis in 2015. Also it would be interesting to see the effects of international efforts that were meant to help refugees.\nPlus, if you want to be as objective as you could possibly be, you should also spend more attention on topics that need to be discussed (not like Venezuela)...﻿"}

Rather than giving a point of view and giving arguments for it, it might be better to lead people to reflect themselves about a problem. It's less frustrating to watch if you disagree with the video, and often leads to better debates and communication. I just think that perhaps you should've left the video on addiction until the new one was released? Just a personnal opinion.\n\nThat got me thinking: Would you make a video about discriminations around the world? Almost all of us are affected by it, and sometimes people (including me) don't see when they are part of a problem.\nFor example, the last gilette message was good in my opinion, and it's sad that so many people were offended by it. Does being a man binds you to a more agressive behavior? Are people legitimate to mock you if you don't want to live by this mindset, and should you remain unprotected to these people because the helping hands you could be getting consider that aggressive conflict is a normal thing between boys?\nI am also personnally affected by the situation of homosexuals around the world. A video about discriminations could perhaps give us an update on the Chechnya issue?﻿"}

I went pretty hardcore on the defense side and I used some points in the addiction video to defend the idea that people who do drugs should be sent to a treatment facility instead of a jail cell and that jail just makes there life's more hard. So 2 things funny about this 1 my 7th grade teacher made you guys \"in a nutshell\" a credible source and I like how video it's self had issues which probably made my 7th grade paper flawed, who cares anyway it got me through 7th grade😂﻿"}

It’s always good when channels can recognise their shortcomings and give transparency to their research methods. Honestly didn’t know that scripts could take up to year, always assumed it was the animation that took the longest time. \n\nBit disappointed however in the decision to delete the two videos. After going back and rewatching them after so many years, I do agree with some of the criticisms you have put forward however the videos are not wrong per se. Rather, as you guys correctly put, they take a too narrow approach to highly complex problems. \n\nWhile I respect the right of individuals and creators to delete content to their liking for privacy and professional reasons; I do hope this does not become a common trend. Having those, regardless of your stance, serve as a history of the channel. Scrubbing them will also mean that future creators might not be able learn from such videos in the future. \n\nHowever thank you for the 12Hr heads up, I am sure the videos will end up somewhere.﻿"}

Right now not only does it look like your triggered but indoctrinated by a specific political group which people will label you as an npc for said group. Also calling someone an ALT righter is the worst thing you can do just because you have a conflicting opinion and genuinely makes people look at your post and think \"gee this guy is a alt leftist who's all touchy feely with no sense of reality\" no offense to you but you should choose your words wisely and not let your emotions dictate what you say﻿"}

And you tend to draw a final, explicit conclusion at the end of a lot of episodes, which often only works in the context of the simplified and abstracted world presented in the video or is in theory correct, but taken on it's own (and that's how a conclusion will always be remembered by most people) can be problematic.\nTo give a recent example: The \"Organic\" video. The conclusion is that organic is not the solution, which is correct. The problem is that most viewers will take this conclusion as an okay for food production to continue as it is now, since \"the alternative\" isn't any better. Of course that is not your stance and not what you said in the video, but people, by human nature, will take this as a confirmation of their opinion, ignoring the details and caveats. That's the danger with a conclusion.\nAnd regarding the conclusion itself: It seems a bit too decisive and simplistic to me, especially since \"organic\" in practice (and legislation for that matter) is very different in different places and entails practices and conventions that aren't included in this top down, abstracted view. Ideally we would try to combine all the good parts of conventional farming and the good parts of organic farming (as said in the video), but that's not how society works.﻿"}

Maybe, but it's something we need in order to live happy and healthy lives. Humans were not designed to be herbivores, nor to be completely carniverous, but omnivores. If you are either a Vegan or a Meat eater chances are you most definetly take fortified foods or supplements so as to not be affected by the cons of being only grass muncher or animal eater. For example:\r\n-Vitamins like B12, K2 and D3 are crucial for the proper functioning of your body, but there is no reliable source for them in plant food, only in meat and products related to animals (eggs, milk, cheese etc.)\r\n- Eating only meat will result in obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and multitude, literally hundred other diseases that will turn your life upside down. On top of that, you are also giving up a reliable sources or variety of vitamins, most of them crucial for your body.\r\n   My conclusion from Kurzgesagt's video about meat is that it's incomplete. It tackles the topic of meat being unhealthy for the planet, but doesn't tackle the topic of meat and meat related products being essential for the proper and healthy life of a human being and also doesn't tackle the topic of plants also being damaging for the planet, especially plants like rice, cotton, sugarcane and soya that are not only extensively agrucultarised and commercially acclaimed across the world, but also super water intensive and require hundreds even thousands of gallons of water for 1kg of produce. \r\n   My final conclusion from Kurzgesagt's video and my own research on the matter - be omnivore and have a balanced and healthy diet. And for the record, yes, Kurzgesagt CAN in fact, be trusted as an accurate source of information, but not an outright complete trust, because that leaves no room for critical thinking.﻿"}

When in fact going vegan is not a valid solution. While I do agree, farming animals for food is not morally good and it does produce CO2, I do think this is the necessary evil to prevent the bigger evil the vegan diet does to our bodies. In the end, nature is as it is, and if you want to survive you have to eat animals.\n\nYes you could survive on vegan diet. But to do so, you need nutrition knowledge, because you have to combine veggies to get all nutrients for survival and on top of this you need B12 and other vitamin supplements in the form of pills or injections. If you don't do either of these right, you will eventually die because of your diet. Note how I say not only B12, that's because plants have evolved to be resilient to canivore and omnivore guts (humans are omnivores), and you can't get all the nutrients a plant has. Most vegans are deficient not only in B12. That's the reason veganism is NOT a solution.\n\nMaybe if we find a way to grow animal meat artificially or genetically engineer plants to contain all nutrients in an easy to get manner, there might be a solution, but so far there is none. So saying we should go vegan is like saying we should stop breathing because every time we exhale, we produce CO2.\n\nThere are countless other ways to reduce CO2, like using public transport instead of personal cars or producing energy in an eco-friendly manner or limit deforestation.\n\nI do appreciate the video you made showing us the process of research and information verification. But I had to voice my concerns. I do hope your future videos will be even better.﻿"}

I only subscribe to a handful of content creators; there are even less that I have watched every video about 3 (including Kurzgesagt). You guys do a great job I watch every new video you upload. Keep up the great work. \n\nIt is hard to impress me, but you guys sure have. It is hard to find a fact driven source of news/content. You guys seem to do your homework.

I subscribed to your channel when I first saw it years ago and have been a dedicated follower ever since.\n\nAn ongoing problem I see with your research is due to the nature of second hand or reported knowledge vs. knowledge gained from experience and accomplishment.  Without a greater depth of personal or \"in-house\" experience on the subjects you  cover you are vulnerable to not only your own personal biases and aspirations but those of the experts you consult as well.  This video shows you are becoming more aware of this and are holding yourselves to the highest standards of ethics and diligence (you need both to keep from overworking yourselves!) so that you will continue to improve.\n\nWhen your experience does reveal deep truths to you, such as trust being continually earned, you share it widely so we can all learn from it and develop our own experience with it, even though we may never know each other personally.  For this I am grateful to you all and I give you my highest commendation.  Keep up the outstanding work!﻿"}

I stumbled across your channel very early on and subscribed immediately - fascinated that a marketing company was publishing science/educational videos. After seeing several good, foundational science topics, I expressed concern over videos that presented (what I understood to be) fringe theories as fact with no citations or attribution... The refugee video pushed me over the edge and I left a scathing message: “Your high production values carry an implied authority. It is irresponsible to deliver highly biased, poorly researched content when you carry this sort of gravity.” I subscribed again in 2018 after some interesting topics popped into my feed with in-video attribution. This video’s self-reflection and correction is exactly what I expect from a group that values science. It was absolutely heart-warming.﻿"}

Also I think the reason your worst researched videos are also your most viewed videos while might in part be due to when they came out, it could also be due to your bias coinciding with the biases of people who traverse youtube and this material. I do wonder about how much you've changed your minds on your first two videos, and how much of it is a kind of psychological doubling down that we all do, and if you would have given more way if it started out more balanced to begin with.  Maybe we'll never know, or maybe we will when you do more psych vids :D :D :D﻿"}

I'm all for transparency, careful, rational approach, open-mindedness, and fair play, but there are times when these things are positively ESSENTIAL to the point(s) one must make. The addiction video, for example (one of my favorite things EVER)...as a veteran and an alcoholic, I can tell you, whatever your route to conclusion was at the time (however single-minded and uneven you retroactively feel it was/is), you were/are ABSOLUTELY correct...at least as far as I was/am concerned. I understand the desire and need for/of research evolution, as it informs solid fact and future scientific method practices of more precise natures, but oftentimes, things simply are what they are, however disliked or questioned or infuriating they are.\n\nAlso, it is important to know that offense/divisiveness/outrage is the most consistently eternal outcome of solid fact AND personal opinion. Having at go at impossible balance via pleasing all people all the time?\n\nThat way lies infinite uncertainty, and crippling self-doubt, which is, under most circumstances, great for exactly no one.\n\nNevertheless, your honesty zeal is refreshing.\n\nKeep up the AWESOME  work, guys and gals.\n\nLavender Jack...Swooping On Down.﻿"}

You make the World and being alive feel amazing over and over again. There just one tiny thing I personaly think you could improve upon: please stop needlessly killing the birds in a gory manner, it's not that funny and doesn't add to the quality of the videos in any way. It's just kinda weird und unpleasant. A graphic representation of an elephant hitting the street after being thrown from a skyscraper is ok as long as it has something to do with what's being said. Birds dying randomly in space while you talk about something completly different is in my humble opinion just bad taste. Death itself is not a pleasant. It can be funny if the joke is good. If there is no joke it just leaves a huge gap of unpleasantness. Other than that, best channel on youtube. Keep it up :)﻿"}

Hank and I talk a lot about the constant risk of \"distortion through simplification.\" As you point out here, often the unequivocal videos with the hottest takes perform better than nuanced videos acknowledging complexity. Part of what makes Kurzgesagt special is that you always strive to make the best videos, rather than following the incentives to just maximize audience. \nOne other note: I've seen in comments below lots of people saying versions of, \"Just don't talk about politics.\" I think this is an oversimplification, because politics touches everything human. You can't talk about meat or drugs or organic food or even loneliness in an \"apolitical\" way, because choices about how we govern and regulate our communities shape all those things. That some facets of human experience (the refugee crisis, for instance) are heavily politicized does not actually mean that they are necessarily more \"political.\" I don't think we can ask or expect any YouTube channel (or any human enterprise) not to be \"political.\" I think we can only ask it to be careful, and to strive for rigor and accuracy. -John﻿"}

And people who do not want to have a say in politics should not have a say in politics, either.\nIn reality, I guess, everyone is left with an expectation of responsibility/maturity which a lot of people just don't know how to handle. A lot of people just don't understand reality anymore.﻿"}

People are busy and don't have time to do this in most cases.  Situations are really complex.  For example, actually reading bills that get voted on in Congress when they are ridiculously long and require some expertise to even understand, and always contain references to past laws that you have to look up.  Whatever narrative they talk and yell about is never the whole story.  Only a small fraction.  To really know what's going on is about two full time jobs worth of work on a constant basis.  So you need a trusted source to objectively tell you what is really happening.  Those sources are really, really rare an hard to find.  And they are definitely underfunded.  But if you just watch the news you can at least pretend like you know what's going on.  No worries, right?  I just end up taking everything with a grain of salt and left wondering what is not being said, and what is misconstrued by everyone.  I find that in the case of Congress, what's most interesting is the things that no one fights over and quietly pass through without issue.﻿"}

This word can be divided into three sylables. 'Ge' is pronounced like ge ('g' like in gold, 'e' like in met). 'Sagt' is also easy to say. It's like 'zagt'. Properly pronounced German 'a' is a bit more frontal than 'a' in art but deeper than 'u' in much. 'Kurz' may be a bit tricky for an English-speaking monolingual person. 'Ku' is pronounced normally but German 'r' in 'kurz' is similar to the French one. (It's not exactly the same but still throaty...) And 'z' is the one consonant with which English speakers have a hard time. It is the same sound as 'c' in Slavic alphabets based on Latin, 'ц' in Cyrillic alphabets and 'צ' in the abjad used by Hebrew and in the alphabets based on the Hebraic script. It is often transcribed as 'ts' (it's just an imperfect approximation). If you get the sounds of 't' and 's' close enough to blend them, you'll pronounce this consonant.﻿"}

There’s a lacking mechanistic understanding of how saturated fat and cholesterol causes heart disease, but we do know IGF-1 increase the risk of cancer, and that red meat, processed meat, and charred meat all raise the risk of colorectal cancer and are class 1 and 2 carcinogens respectively. Dr. Garth Davis has a video that goes in to great detail about the mechanistic data. On top of this, there are massive amounts of cohort meta analyses and individual epidemiological studies that unoquivically link saturated and cholesterol to heart disease, due to the build of and oxidization or arterial plaque. Whether you do the carnivore diet because it makes you feel better due to an undiagnosed gluten, of fruit/vegetable allergy, or that you have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, the meat diet is only masking and not fixing the issue. Herbal antibiotics and other prescriptive measures are necessary, then you can avoid the unnecessary carcinogens of meat and other associated health risks, and start taking your health in to your own hands with an antioxidant rich, oil free, whole food plant based diet (which matches our physiology according to “21 questions on atherosclerosis” and our evolution according to many sources that point out, cooking carbohydrates like tubers lead to extra calories and carbohydrates, and glucose for the brain the thrive and develop).﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugwpe7KQTMCI9ZzSJEJ4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Thoughts can create worlds. Every time you dream, you make worlds out of your own thoughts. You do not make dreamworlds out of atoms, out of “matter”. How many people grasp the significance of this fact? A dream, in and of itself, proves that a mind can create what convincingly passes as a material world, even though the dreamworld emphatically isn’t material, but is made of thoughts produced by the mind of the dreamer.\n\nMaterialists claim, with no evidence, that matter can create minds. A dream proves that a mind can produce the commonly accepted effect of matter, so we know for a fact that thought can be made to resemble matter. The simplest question then arises: why should we not conclude that the objective material world is itself made of thought, i.e. there is no such thing as matter in itself.\n\nWhy don’t we indulge in the boldest of thoughts? If one mind can build a dreamworld out of its own thoughts, what would happen if all minds dreamt together? What world might they create with their united effort, with their thoughts pulled together and operating as one? In fact, they would build the very world we are living in right now!\n\nThe most important thing isn’t matter, as scientists would have you believe, it’s thought. Thoughts are contained within minds, and the universal thought – the objective world – is contained within the Cosmic Mind. Nothing exists outside this Mind. It is the All.\n\nThe world is not made of matter. It is made of thoughts shared by all the minds in existence. What was the Big Bang? It was when the Cosmic Mind – the Collective Mind made of all individual minds – started DREAMING. It was a wholly mental event. Creation was born of a dream, a very special dream, a shared dream of all minds, propagated mathematically. Dreaming is simply the output of monadic minds performing ontological Fourier mathematics.\n\nEastern religion talks of Maya – illusion – concealing reality from us. The truth is that our reality is an illusion – a dream – but it is grounded in the most objective mathematical and non-illusory mathematical processes you can possibly get. Reality is nothing but the activity of mind. It has nothing to do with mindless “matter”.\n\nThis is a universe of thought, and nothing but mind matters.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugy2kYRcN8aTP8WksuR4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "From Book 1: This is the introductory text of the \"God Series\" of books in which the Pythagorean Illuminati reveal, for the first time in the public domain, the \"answer to everything\".\n\nPythagoras provided a glimpse of the answer 2,500 years ago when he declared, \"All things are numbers\". The God series fully reveals what Pythagoras meant. Mathematics - built from numbers - is not an abstraction but is ontological: it actually exists. Numbers are real things. Specifically, they are the frequencies of energy waves. (Moreover, energy waves are simply sinusoidal waves: sines and cosines, meaning that the study of energy is the study of sinusoids). There are infinity energy waves, hence infinite numbers. No numbers are privileged over any others, so negative and imaginary numbers are as ontologically important as real numbers (upon which scientific materialism is exclusively based).\n\nReal numbers correspond to space and imaginary numbers to time. Negative numbers are \"antimatter\": a mirror image universe.\n\nThe two most powerful numbers of all - and the ultimate basis of Illuminist thinking - are zero and infinity, which are harnessed together ontologically (opposite sides of the same coin, so to speak). The existence of zero and infinity is vehemently denied by the ideology of scientific materialism. In Illuminism, these two numbers not only exist, they are the \"God\" numbers: the origin of all other numbers. Zero and infinity comprise the Big Bang Singularity itself from which an infinitely large universe emerged: \"everything\" literally came from \"nothing\".\n\nMoreover, zero is also the \"monad\" of Leibniz (an Illuminati Grand Master). It is therefore the number of THE SOUL, and it has INFINITE capacity. Being dimensionless - a mathematical point - the soul is outside the dimensional, material domain of space and time, hence the soul is indestructible, immortal and cannot be detected by any conventional scientific experiment.\n\nWhat we are describing are the necessary, analytic, eternal truths of mathematics - they have no connection with Abrahamic religious faith. There is NO Creator God but, astoundingly, each soul is capable of being promoted to God status, just as the pawn in chess can become the most important chess piece, the Queen, if it reaches the other side of the battlefield (the board). In Illuminism, if you reach gnosis - enlightenment - you become God.\n\nMathematics is literally everything. Unlike science, mathematics offers certainty: 100% true and incontestable knowledge. Mathematics unifies science, religion and metaphysics. Mathematics is the true Grand Unified Theory of Everything that science pursues so futilely. Science can never deliver truth and certainty because it is inherently a succession of provisional theories, any of which can be overturned at any time by new experimental data. Science is based on ideas of validation and falsification. Mathematics is based on absolute analytic and unarguable certainty. No experiment can ever contradict a mathematical truth.\n\nMathematics is the ONLY answer to everything. Mathematics is the ONLY subject inherently about eternal, Platonic truth. As soon as existence is understood to be nothing but ontological mathematics, all questions are ipso facto answered.\n\nThe God series, starting with The God Game, reveals the astonishing power of ontological mathematics to account for everything, including things such as free will, irrationalism, emotion, consciousness and qualia, which seem to have no connection with mathematics.﻿"}

The problem is, even people who believe evolution is true disassociate themselves from the process. They somehow skipped all the lower forms of animal life and just started out at the top of the evolutionary ladder.\n \nThe evidence says we evolved as life evolved.\n \nHuman beings did not just appear at the top of the evolutionary ladder to reap the benefits of those millions of years of evolution without having to live through it.\n \nIn other words, you were those other animals. Someone had to be them.\n \nYou had to be lower animals to be a human now. You lived as all the different animals in your evolutionary line. You lived through millions of years, and millions of lives and deaths to get where you are now. That's what Darwin's book means.\n \nIn addition to the fossil evidence, the genetic code proves that all animals, including us, evolved from bacteria over the last 700 million years on earth.\n \nIn other words, you were a microbe, an insect, a fish, a dinosaur, an ape...\n \nWhen all of the evidence (100%) says something happened, and there is no evidence (zero) that anything else could have happened, it is the truth beyond a reasonable doubt to honest, rational people.\n \nWe have come a very, very long way, but we have a little further to go. The next and last step in our evolution is learning and accepting the truth of life, and this includes acknowledging our true past.\n \nYou will die physically, but you will be born into a new physical body. Being born happens, or you would not be here now. You were born into this life. It is what we know happens. There is no evidence anything else happens. True or false?\n \nThe \"you only live once\" theory: Many people say that they do not believe in reincarnation; they believe when you die, you're dead. What about fish, clams, horses, bears, flies? People that say you only live once are saying some souls get to live just one life as a worm, and that is it for all of eternity.\n \nOther people believe you are judged by a god after you die. Is the worm judged?\n\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another. Albert Einstein\n \nLike energy, consciousness cannot be created or destroyed.\n \nThis revelation will change your life. Now you know where you come from and what you've been doing for about half a billion years (evolving). The next question is how does life work and what is next, and we can know that too.\n \n2                                             \n \n \n \nPeople are trying to understand the universe independent of consciousness, and it is the most important factor in the equation.\n \nThe universe as it relates to conscious life can be understood now. It is the ultimate truth of life; the truth that will transform mankind and the world.\n \n\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" F(AB) = -F(BA)\n\nPeople do not realize what Isaac Newton's third law of motion really means.\n \nEverything is balanced. Everything physical (matter/energy) goes back and forth in balanced circles, cycles, or the equivalent. Birth- death, old-young, big-small, strong-weak, start-stop, up-down, rich-poor, beginning-end, fast-slow, hot-cold, pain-pleasure, win-lose, day-night, full-empty, high-low, in-out, success-failure, united-divided, give-receive, creation-destruction, on-off, positive-negative, etc.\n \nPositive and negative forces moving in balance are the physical universe.\n \nThere are no exceptions to the laws of nature Newton revealed. They apply to all matter and energy. Human beings are matter and energy, thus you and all humans are governed by the same laws.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugx6r-YO1qDqNwvua6t4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Splitting Light\n\nNo experiment would be more earth shattering than the one that showed that a photon can be split: into a chronon and choran. An entirely new theory of matter can be constructed from these particles. In a photon, a chronon of a certain frequency is perfectly allied to a choran of the same frequency. They have an analytic, orthogonal relationship, hence they create a dimensionless union. They are the agents of mind. Now imagine taking a vast set of photons and subjecting them to the incredibly high energy of the Big Bang. This succeeds in splitting many of the (low energy) photons into their component chronons and chorans. Once this is done, we can then start putting them together again. But what if we join them together non-orthogonally? And what if we put together chronons and chorans of different frequencies? It’s when these mismatches take place that we generate new types of particles: material particles that exist in space and time rather than dimensionlessly. To be clear, when chronons and chorans are perfectly matched up, we get photons, which are particles that exist in an immaterial frequency domain of mind (a Singularity). When chronons and chorans are put together in any way other than perfectly, we get all of the particles of the material world of spacetime. Every material particle, like every photon, is a combination of a time particle and a space particle. In the case of photons, the time and space particles are so mathematically well-balanced that photons are both dimensionless and immaterial. In the case of material particles, this is not the case. Material particles, despite comprising mismatched time and space particles, can nevertheless produce highly stable particles such as electrons and quarks. In turn, quarks can come together to produce stable protons and neutrons. That is, there are mathematically stable ways of combining non-matched chorans and chronons. Perhaps a wave with exactly twice the frequency of the other wave will work, or a wave with a phase difference of 30, 45 or 60 degrees compared to the other. The idea is to build up a set of stable sinusoidal patterns that we can then map to all of the known material particles, and show that they are actually derived from photons, i.e. from mathematical sinusoids. This turns them into mathematical rather than scientific entities. In this way, we can reduce the entire “particle zoo” to analytic sinusoids, and replace science with ontological mathematics.﻿"}

A flowing point, hence a particle, is a tiny information package expressing energy. During a collision, it acts like a localised thing (i.e. a particle). When it’s travelling, it moves like a wave. Trillions of flowing points acting in concert (as in the case of a bullet, for example) have a wave profile that averages out to a straight line. This is why quantum (wave) phenomena are typically seen only in the case of isolated particles, i.e. in microscopic rather than macroscopic instances. This is where large-scale averaging effects have not had the opportunity to conceal wave effects. The waves are still there in the macroscopic cases, of course, but they are buried in the mathematical detail.﻿"}

We can associate the cosine wave with a choran (space particle), and the sine wave with a chronon (a time particle). Such a pairing is strictly dimensionless. It has no spacetime signature. The reason for this is simple. A choran is maximally length contracted, i.e. it has zero length. This is equivalent to saying that distance passes infinitely slowly, or, more accurately, that the choran simply isn’t in space at all (it’s in the frequency domain). A chronon, on the other hand, is maximally time dilated, i.e. time passes infinitely slowly, or, more accurately, that the chronon simply isn’t in time at all (it’s in the frequency domain). So, neither component of the photon is in spacetime. The choran is in the frequency domain, not in space, and has no relationship to time. The chronon is in the frequency domain too, not in time, and has no relationship to space. The interaction of the choran and chronon is thus entirely outside spacetime, leaving them with a null spacetime signature. Together, they form an \"electromagnetic standing wave.\"﻿"}

They are so indoctrinated to deny the existence of mind that they attempt to define light as a form of matter rather than matter as a form of light (broken light, to be exact). The truth of reality is that a permanent mental Singularity exists at the heart of the spacetime material world, and controls that world mathematically – via light (which conveys the thoughts of the Cosmic Mind). A photon, as we have seen, is simply the pairing of a sine wave and a cosine wave in a perfect orthogonal relation to each other. A material particle is produced by any arrangement in which sine- cosine orthogonality breaks down and the sine and cosine waves have any phase relation that is not exactly ninety degrees. It’s all in the math. The material world is the product of broken thought. It’s a mental construct, arising from non- orthogonal sinusoidal phase relations. What could be more straightforward?﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "UgzDDRNJWlM2Rh3x8BV4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Our minds contain every single number in existence, and these numbers correspond to thoughts. Thoughts = numbers. The cosmic goal of all minds is to organize their innate Myriad numbers/thoughts in the absolute, most symmetric/beautiful way possible. In other words, the cosmic goal of a mind is to organize its internal thoughts into the most rational, intelligent, and clear thinking mental structure possible. This perfect mental symmetry corresponds to ontological mathematical perfection, and it is the very goal and purpose of life/mind.\n\nOver many, many lifetimes, ontological mathematical minds (i.e. us) work to get their internal numbers perfectly balanced. Once they achieve their sacred objective, they then become mathematically perfect.  Mathematical perfection equates to perfect mental mathematical symmetry. It equates to gnosis. It equates to enlightenment. It equates to Divinity. This is the purpose of your life. This is the purpose of all life.\n\nYour purpose in life ISN’T to buy the newest capitalist gadget on the market. Your purpose in life ISN’T to make evil/rich capitalists any richer. Your purpose in life ISN’T to slave your life away at a job you fucking HATE. Your purpose in life ISN’T to drink booze. It ISN’T to take drugs. It ISN’T to eat shit food (i.e. poison). It ISN’T to watch the ball game, or the fight, or the race, or the movie, or the television show, or the YouTube video, or anything else. Your purpose ISN’T to play video games. It ISN’T to hang out with friends. It ISN’T to social network. It ISN’T to vote in fraudulent Dumbocratic elections. It ISN’T to pray. It ISN’T to meditate. It has nothing to do with evil churches, synagouges, mosques, temples, priests, monks, prophets, imams, popes, rabbis, or gurus. It has nothing to do with karma. It has nothing to do with materialism, empiricism, or relativism. It has nothing to do with nihilism and atheism.\n\nNo, your purpose in life has nothing to do with ANY of the above dog shit. Your True purpose in life is all about you being the best you that you can possibly be, and this totally revolves around how rational you are.\n\nRationality and humanity are directly linked. The more rational you are, the more human you are.  The less rational you are, the less human and more bestial you are. The ability to think, self reflect, and use reason is what differentiates humanity from the other species on this planet. Humans are supposed to be striving to become as conscious (i.e. as human) as possible, and consciousness/humanity is developed through the study of reason = ontological mathematics. This is the purpose of life. It is the purpose of my life, your life, and all life.\n\nJust look at the hoards of rampaging Abrahamists (i.e. those who are defined by their pure hatred of reason, rationality, and clear thinking) as they murder, rape, and pillage their way across the planet, to see precisely how reason is indissolubly linked to humanity, consciousness, and sanity, while hatred of reason is indissolubly linked to violence, genocide, intolerance, racism, sexism, and homophobia, i.e. hatred of reason IS evil. These Abrahamic “people” hate reason.  Indeed, one of their heroes, the depraved Martin Luther, specifically said, “Reason is the Devil’s whore”.  (Martin Luther was a person hell bent on keeping human beings from discovering and fulfilling their very purpose for existing, just like all of his modern day Abrahamist clones are.) Every single one of these raving Abrahamic lunatics are evil incarnate.\n\nAbrahamists are evil, insane, intolerant, violent, genocidal, racist, sexist, homophobic, monsters precisely because they’re irrational. It is exactly their raging hatred of reason that makes Abrahamists so barbaric. If Abrahamists were to ever miraculously begin practicing rational, reasonable, sane, logical, clear thinking, they would immediately start to become more tolerant and sane people.\n\nIf any single Abrahamist were to ever begin studying reason, then they would immediately begin to become less evil, less insane, less intolerant, less violent, less genocidal, less racist, less sexist, less homophobic, and less monstrous. If this hypothetical Abrahamist were to continue studying reason, then his/her lunacy and inhumanity would continue to decrease until it eventually disappeared entirely. Reason can literally heal our world.\n\nTo reiterate: Rationalism VS Irrationalism is a zero sum game. The more you partake of reason and rationality, the more intelligent, wise, humane, and sane you will become, and the closer you will be to fulfilling your purpose for existing. The more you partake of unreason and irrationality, the more unintelligent, unwise, inhumane, and insane you will become, and the farther you will be from fulfilling you purpose for existing.  So think carefully about how you live your life.\n\nThe study of reason is THE activity that transforms us and turns us into Divinities.  The study of reason reveals to you exactly what you need to do with your current life to help push yourself closer to the Omega Point. It reveals to you what you need to do in this life to live the best possible life you can.﻿"}

Viewed from spacetime, light travels at the speed of light in spacetime. \nSingularity: electromagnetic standing waves.\nSpacetime: electromagnetic travelling waves. (From the spacetime perspective, electromagnetic standing waves in the frequency Singularity are translated into, or perceived as, travelling waves in spacetime.) Reality is all about standing and travelling electromagnetic waves, all about intact and “broken” electromagnetic waves. There’s nothing else. It’s all in the math. Electromagnetic standing waves in the frequency Singularity are eternal, necessary, indestructible and reflect the mathematical First Law of Energy Conservation. Electromagnetic standing waves are what souls are made from. Souls are therefore eternal vibrations of light. Those vibrations are none other than thoughts! Electromagnetic standing waves = thoughts. “Matter” is made of travelling waves that, due to asymmetric phase relations, have mathematically broken out of the standing-wave Singularity. From their perspective, light becomes a travelling wave rather than stationary wave! Existence is all about light, all about thought, all about life, all about how light “breaks” to form darkness (matter)! Everything is about electromagnetic waves and their relations.\nA photon, as we have seen, is simply the pairing of a sine wave and a cosine wave in a perfect orthogonal relation to each other. A material particle is produced by any arrangement in which sine- cosine orthogonality breaks down and the sine and cosine waves have any phase relation that is not exactly ninety degrees. It’s all in the math. The material world is the product of broken thought. It’s a mental construct, arising from non- orthogonal sinusoidal phase relations. What could be more straightforward?\n\nThe universe is made of light. The photonic building blocks of existence are matching pairs of cosine and sines, i.e. every photon is a sine wave of a specific frequency paired with a cosine wave of the same frequency. Photons are dimensionless. Dimensional existence is created when photons are split and their component sine and cosine waves get scrambled (i.e. they enter into asymmetric and non-orthogonal phase relations). Reality comprises nothing but light and broken light. There can be nothing else. Minds are light. Human thoughts are high-energy photons. Matter is made from low energy, broken photons (matter is made from “darkness”, so to speak). The Big Bang involution creates the dark universe of matter (broken light), and evolution ultimately causes the darkness and matter to be dispelled, allowing everything to return to the light. At the Big Bang, light breaks. At the Big Crunch, light is restored to perfection. That’s the cyclical, inevitable trajectory of existence. The universe, like any wave (and the universe is of course made of waves) has a period, and this period, naturally, is repeated over and over again forever.﻿"}

Science can make no further progress until it fully embraces the ontological reality of mathematics and ALL numbers. Here we are in the 21st century having to point out to scientists that Western mathematics fell radically behind Eastern mathematics because it refused to accept some key numbers. For exactly the same reasons – indeed exactly the same numbers! – science has ground to a standstill in terms of coming up with a “final”, comprehensive theory. Science will never get anywhere until it accepts the ontological reality of the numbers we listed above. So, Illuminism alone represents the highest wisdom of humanity. The Illuminati have no rivals. We are peerless. We are way ahead of the curve, astonishingly far in front of the rest of humanity. Why? Simply because we were guided by reason and not faith, by intellect and not the senses. We had no difficulty with the concept of “unseen” things. Why should everything be seen? There is no sufficient reason why everything should be physical and detectable. We have done a simply astounding thing. We have dragged soul/mind/life/subjectivity from the land of woo woo, wacky religious and New Age theories and made it the beating heart of mathematics, hence entirely amenable to mathematical analysis. All mystical nonsense about the soul can now be dispensed with. The whole Logos world can start treating the mysteries of life, mind, consciousness, soul, self and subjectivity from the mathematical perspective. Metaphysics can be redefined as “dimensionless” mathematics, while physics is “dimensional” mathematics. The two together describe reality. The age of the religious domination of the “soul” is over. Now it belongs to the domain of mathematicians, scientists, philosophers, metaphysicians and psychologists. We have wrenched it from the poisonous grasp of the priests and popes, the imams and rabbis, the ancient false prophets and inveterate liars. Soul no longer has anything to do with faith. It’s all about rationality and logic. Smart people become the “saved” and stupid people the “damned”. Remember this: the soul is the principle of LIFE. It is also the quintessence of mind. Soul, life, mind and subjectivity are all synonymous. They all relate to the number ZERO (and zero’s flip side, infinity). What could be more important than saving the soul from the Mythos religious fanatics? Now the Logos rationalists can lay absolute claim to it. The division between religion and science is OVER. Both are united in adamantine mathematics. The priest caste can now be overthrown. Their pernicious rule over humanity is at an end. All holy texts can be incinerated. All “prophets” can be condemned for the liars, charlatans and madmen they were and are.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "UgzvUsfjikrkFHZ3Cr14AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Dreams\n\nOne of the most mysterious aspects of human existence is that when we go to sleep we enter a dreamworld. What is this extraordinary world and how does it relate to the waking world? Normal consciousness interacts with the objective world, so we might alternatively designate this as “objective consciousness”. But what about the kind of consciousness we have in dreams? This is “subjective consciousness” and it’s marked by a lack of formal causality and an absence of a fixed and objective time and space framework. Another of its key features is that we have to invent our interactions with others who appear in our dreamworld. We put words in their mouths; we control their movements and behaviour – as if we were Gods, or at any rate storytellers constructing a novel in our mind. Just as a novelist is the dictator of his story world, deciding everything that happens, so each of us is the dictator and creative director of our dreamworld. Novels are nothing but dreams on paper. Movies are dreams on celluloid or digital media. They are all about Mythos. Dreams have almost no Logos content. They are mostly about the emotions and heightened senses, and now and again powerful intuitions come to us. Yet reason, the youngest and most immature feature of the human condition, barely features. Dreams evolved long before reason did and they take us back to a more primitive time. In our dreams, we return to what humans were like at the dawn of human time. It’s a world of magic rather than science; where anything can happen and there’s no tyranny of objective laws. We can do anything we want in our dreams. We can resurrect the dead and have vivid encounters with them, we can have fantastic sex with dream lovers, we can be plunged into the worst nightmares conceivable, and so on. Dreams are perhaps the most incredible phenomenon of human existence. Humanity’s religious thinking derived from dreams because they pointed to the existence of another domain beyond this one where the dead still lived. Dreams do indeed give us a glimpse of a radically different reality, one not dependent on objectivity. Dreams foreshadow the possibility of death admitting us to a purely subjective mental experience where we survive indefinitely but we have to make up all of the events that happen to us, because nothing objective can ever enter this subjective fantasy. Dreams show how we could, mentally, survive objective, physical death. Reincarnation is the post-mortem process that releases us from this subjective fantasy world and places us back in a body in the objective world. Gnosis is the final process that allows us to escape the cycle of reincarnation and gives us an objective, not subjective, “God consciousness” whereby we remain without a physical body but possess an objective rather than subjective consciousness. We can know all things and interact with all things – objectively rather than in a fantasy of our own creation. So, humans have different types of consciousness: A) objective consciousness (awareness of the objective world; this consciousness dies when the objective body dies). subjective consciousness (awareness of a dream space disconnected from objective reality; this consciousness does not perish with the body but the price it pays is that it engages with a wholly fabricated reality). C) the possibility of a God consciousness that remains objective even without a physical body.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugz3X8fdpTXyoNok5FR4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "In Illuminism, particles (flowing points) are real and they have an inbuilt wave trajectory. (Defined by Euler's Formula) In the absence of any interference, we would be able to state exactly where the particle would be next (the next part of the wave trajectory). In this sense, the particle might be said to have a pilot wave guiding it, and thus the Illuminist view is similar to the Hidden Variables view, except it does not formally posit a real wave preceding the particle. The wave trajectory is instead mathematically programmed into the particle, (Defined by Euler's Formula) and continuously adjusts to reflect interaction with the environment. The Copenhagen interpretation asserts wave-particle duality on the basis of unreal particles coupled to unreal wavefunctions that can inexplicably “collapse” and produce real effects. The Hidden Variables interpretation asserts wave-particle duality on the basis of real particles coupled to real (but non-local) pilot waves. The pilot wave can momentarily collapse to allow a particle effect to be exhibited. In Illuminism, there are only particles (flowing points) as ontological realities, but they follow wave trajectories that are mathematically programmed into them. In Illuminism, all actual processes, causes and effects are occurring at the flowing point level, but this is an incredibly complicated level since countless flowing points are interacting according to their respective internal wave programming, leading to all of the extraordinary phenomena of quantum mechanics. In Illuminism, it must be emphasised, reality is mathematical and not physical, meaning, in short, that it’s based on complex numbers rather than real numbers, hence has an enormously different repertoire of behaviours, some of which are inexplicable from the real-number perspective of mainstream science. The Copenhagen interpretation is so crazy because it’s attempting the impossible: to interpret a universe of complex numbers using only their real number component and ignoring their equally critical imaginary number component. The mad claims of the Copenhagen interpretation flow directly from this mathematical mayhem. The “real number” mindset of scientists is fatally attracted to solid, physical lumps moving in straight lines. The “complex number” paradigm of Illuminism is based on the generalised Euler Formula and thus inherently involves sine and cosine waves. The wave effects of the twin-slit experiment are thus no surprise at all. They are inevitable. Scientists, with their bias for linear motion, can’t help imagining particles being fired in straight lines at the twin slits. Clearly, this raises certain expectations of what pattern should be found on the detection screen. Illuminism replaces particles moving in linear trajectories with particles moving in sinusoidal trajectories, which generates a very different expectation of what will be seen on the detection screen. The Copenhagen interpretation arose from the inability of mainstream scientists to give any more than a cursory thought to how particles might move in sinusoidal rather than linear trajectories. They thought about the problem from the perspective of familiar physical waves (such as ocean waves) and did not consider analytic, mathematical wave trajectories programmed into particles. Having rejected the idea of particles moving as waves, scientists ran out of road for sensible answers to the twin-slit experiment and thus invented the lunacy of the Copenhagen interpretation with its implicit extrapolation that the moon doesn’t exist when you’re not looking at. Even today, almost a century later, no one understands the “reality” proposed by the Copenhagen interpretation. That’s because there’s no reality principle at all in this interpretation. The Copenhagen interpretation isn’t science but philosophy. Science – true science – relies on a reality principle and experiments performed on objective reality. The Copenhagen interpretation posits an unreality principle and experiments performed on an unreal wavefunction. It deals in probabilities rather than certainties. It formally denies causality itself at the ultimate level of existence. Are you buying it? You’d have to be mad to sign up to this ludicrous Mythos.﻿"}

The Argument from Authority. They say because it came from an \"expert\"(note that these individuals are never named as far as I know) their statements must be considered gospel. And while it is admerable that they seek other \"experts\" for a second check, it still points to a major issue.\n\n\nHow does Kurzgesagt define \"expert\"? When it came to the Climate Change video, did they check with any experts who felt that humans were not the singe driving force for the change? Or did they check with any experts who think that the change might end up being a net positive? Unlikely, in my opinion. Kurzgesagt most likely has a worldview that they want to support in the end. While they might find a new route to it, they still want to support that worldview.\n\n\nThere's a piece of evidence of this worldview in the video. Do we honestly believe that the asked a bunch of experts, twice mind you, and never once ran into the completely disagreeing with each other?\n\n\nFunny how they decided not to cover the Refugee video again. Wonder if the terrorism, \"No Go Zones\" and the child grooming might reflect badly on their world view.\n\n\nAnd they are adding sources to old videos. But these will be sources that THEY pick. That THEY screen. That THEY feel is correct.\n\n\nThe videos are fun to watch, but I never come here outright for education.﻿"}

Let me clarify that by saying that I do trust you guys to some extent. I trust you to inform me somewhat and do it in an entertaining way that I can completely digest in a couple of minutes. That being said the research part of everything is what I usually don't trust. Most sources are \"good\" because they are peer reviewed. That's not what makes a source good. That's not what makes research any good and any good scientist would know that. When can a scientist reliably trust the information he is given? Ask yourself that. The answer? Simple. The scientist can only trust the information when a few criteria are met. First, the scientist knows what the research is about, obviously. Second, he knows how said research was performed. Namely what tools were used, what criteria was held for the study, the length of the study, the weight, girth, anything that was a control in said study the scientist knows. Third, he knows exactly how to replicate the study and can do so with relative ease. Fourth and final, he replicates the study and comes to the same conclusion. Now, if scientists are held at such high standards, why then do we the people not hold the information they give to the same standard? Because we are lazy and have other things on our minds obviously. \n\nBut there is a bigger issue here. The issue I'm talking about is the issue where science and everyday life intertwine. That's when we absolutely must hold the same standards as scientists because it does affect us. For instance that meat video. That had a tremendous effect on society as a whole. There are now people who get aggressive and very violent about meat eating. Meat eaters had no problem with that unless they wanted the opposite sex who happened to be vegan. Why is all this important? Because somehow, a single piece of information turned on an entire generation of new people who do care about that information. And that generation now affects the other generations.\n\nTo conclude. Bringing a conclusion to a certain study is fine. But tell people how you got there and why. And make it an easy to digest list like you guys at kurzgesagt are doing. Or  at least try to ^^.\nSomething like and excel spreadsheet or something. It may not be necessary but it refines the data and makes sure that people can draw their own conclusion and come to an understanding much quicker. Let the people help.

Precisely thanks to that fact, each of us can gain 100% knowledge of the universe and know everything, i.e we can all become GODS. \nEach soul exists in two different ways: 1) privately (in relation to itself, to its own inner space, its own \"dream world\") but also 2) as one node of the whole monadic collection. It's this latter context that constitutes the real, external, objective world that we mistake as a material world independent of minds. In fact, it's a collective construct of all those minds. Just as a single mind can generate an internal dream world, so can the whole mind collective, but now that dream is regarded as external to each individual mind, and, moreover, it obeys firm, rigid, objective mathematical rules and laws — precisely those studied by science as the alleged basis of the \"material\" world. The collective dream world is rather like The Matrix, and we are all plugged into it. It wasn't an artificial intelligence that created it, but our own minds. So how does the film The Matrix match up to true reality? In the movie, there is both a real world (a post-Apocalyptic wasteland) and a simulated world that resembles a previous peaceful period of human history. People have real bodies but these are all in life-support incubators plugged into the simulated reality. Their simulated bodies match their actual bodies. Each real person is permantly asleep, but experiences two different sleeping modes: \"waking sleep\" (when they are directly part of the Matrix simulation and doing things within it) and \"sleeping sleep\" (when they go to sleep within the Matrix and are no longer interacting with it). When people \"wake\" from sleeping sleep, they enter the waking sleep of \"normal\" Matrix life, but no one completely wakes up (to true reality) unless they are explicitly unplugged from the Matrix. Death in the Matrix causes death in real life. (In other words, the simulation can kill you.)\nOutside the movies (!). Reality comprises a world of minds. Each mind is plugged into the \"material\" world. (Collectively generated by all of the minds), where it's attached to a specific material body. When its body is awake, the mind is linked to the \"objective reality\" of the material world. When its body is asleep, the mind retreats to its own subjective hinterland where it creates its own dream worlds, over which it has complete control. In this system, the mind is never asleep; only the body sleeps. The status of the body — sleeping or waking — determines what experiences the mind has (subjective or objective). A sleeping body in effect frees the mind from objective, body-focused reality. Your dreams, remarkably are the proof that your mind can exist and function without a body, and hence that the death of your body is irrelevant to your mind, except that it deprives your mind of a link to the objective world of other minds. Only via reincarnation is a new bodily connection established. Death is thus simply super-sleep. Normally when you go to sleep, you wake up in your familiar body, but following death, you wake up in a brand new body (that of a newborn baby!), with all of your previous consciousness memories erased. As the Ancient Greeks liked to say to explain why people couldn't remember their past lives, you have drunk of the deep waters of forgetfulness of the underworld river known as Lethe. Death resets your consciousness of the objective world, but does not reset your mind itself, which has full knowledge of all past lives. Death and sleep are basically the same process, but with death effecting a much more radical transition upon \"waking\". The study of sleep and dreams should be one of the key activities of the human race since all of the mysteries of life and death are contained in sleeping and dreaming. Yet this subject is barely studied at all. That's mostly thanks to the scientific materialists, who have an inverted understanding of reality, putting matter above mind. Your body isn't a physical \"thing\", it's a mental construct, a kind of avatar that operates on your behalf in the objective world. The key to understanding the material world lies in quantum mechanics. Quantum particles are simply \"thoughts\" that emerge from individual minds into the collective mental arena, where they become \"objective\" rather than \"subjective\", and thus seem like solid, persistent things (i.e. material objects). They are external rather than internal thoughts. Individual particles display the extremely bizarre behaviour well known in the quantum world because they are so closely related to mental rather than physical things. Only collections of trillions upon trillions of quantum particles take on the solid character of the familiar material objects of our world. If we subjected any physical body to a powerful enough microscope, it would, at the highest resolutions, dissolve into oblivion because its particles would vanish into the non-physical minds from which they originally came. Your \"normal\" thoughts are internal and subjective (unextended; dimensionless), but what happens when your thoughts become external and objective (extended and dimensional)? Then they are converted into quantum entities, shared between all of the minds of the universe, and multitudes of interacting quantum particles produce the illusion of a solid, material world. Matter is, however, just a different kind of mental expression: objective rather than subjective, external rather than internal, extended rather than unextended, dimensional rather than dimensionless. \"Matter\" is produced by the thinking of an infinite collection of minds, while normal thoughts are produced by individual minds. So, everything boils down to minds operating on their own and minds operating collectively. Nothing else is going on. Reality is all about minds and thinking, and that's it. There's no mysterious \"matter\" independent of minds and thinking. To grasp Illuminism, the religion of the Illuminati, you have to abolish all thoughts of matter as an independent entity, minds create matter; matter does not create minds. All matter is actually alive insofar as it all belongs to living minds. This position is known as hylozoism — living matter. We could equally refer to panpsychism, meaning that mind is everywhere and in everything. What, then, is the difference between a living body and a lump of rock? Both are made of the exact same stuff, atoms generated by the Mind Collective. Atoms derive from the energy content of minds, but are not minds themselves. (Rather, they are psychoid: relating to mind; resulting from mind). \"Living things\" are those things that are directly and and efficiently controlled by individual monads. Life is a continuum and things are more alive to the extent that they allow the expression of individual wills. A lump of rock does not express any meaningful will at all, so it can be concluded that either it has no active, individual controlling mind (it is under the passive control of the Mind Collective, hence obeys the deterministic laws of mathematics) or any individual mind linked to it cannot achieve any significant degree of expression, so any such mind is both passive and totally unconscious. A plant is a living thing, but barely expresses more will than a rock, however, any individual mind linked to it is slightly more active and slightly less unconscious than that of a rock. Animals are higher again on the scale and individual controlling minds of animals are active and \"pre-conscious\". Them come human beings. Human beings have controlling minds that are active and conscious (meaning that they are self-aware and can excercise authentic freewill — such minds are what we properly call \"souls\"). They are active souls as opposed to passive souls. On earth, DNA is the crucial factor that allows minds to exert meaningful control over bodies and thus generate the phenomenon of life. Everything is in fact alive since mathematical minds are the only things that actually exist, but only a few of these minds can express their life meaninfully, via bodies they control in the material world. DNA is the \"living code\": the way of organising atoms in such a way as to allow individual minds to take direct control of bodies made of DNA and express themselves through those bodies. DNA is a mathematical information code and contains enormously more information, order and organisation than a lump of rock. It wasn't Darwinian evolution by natural selection that created DNA, but continual attemps by individual minds — over hundreds of millions of years — to create atomic and molecular information systems over which they could exert direct mathematical control.﻿"}

All minds are on a scale of passivity versus activity and unconsciousness versus consciousness. The higher your mind is on the scale, the more active and conscious you are, and the more you control your own destiny. Gods have the highest minds on the scale: they are completely active and conscious. They have fully incorporated all unconscious elements.\n\n\"Matter\", it must be emphasized, does not belong to individual minds and is not defined by individual minds. It belongs to infinite minds and is defined in that context. Since each mind is trivial compared with the whole collection of minds, no ordinary mind can hope to influence the material world, except in the limited arena of its own physical actions, carried out its own body. The material world is therefore a world of rules and laws that no ordinary mind can ever defy. These rules and laws were there before we were born and will be there after we die. These rules and laws endure forever, although, periodically, the universe itself dies and reincarnates. The death of the universe is the same as the death of an individual, but on a cosmic scale; the cosmic mind then requiers a new body and it generates it via a cosmic mental event know as the Big Bang! Mathematically, the Big Bang is an anti-symmetry event involving infinite minds. We have described this in detail elsewhere in The God Series.﻿"}

When we awaken, we re-enter “reality” – the public space.\n\nWe are always dreaming, except sometimes we are dreaming singly and at the other times we are dreaming collectively.\n\nThe material world is not there as anything other than a shared product of the contents of our minds. It’s wholly dependent on mind and has no independent reality. It’s a “scientific” arena because it operates according to the single language that all monads understand: mathematics.\n\nThe mathematics that applies to the shared universe are extremely rigid, predictable and objective. However, when we dream privately, we are no longer subject to these objective rules, which is why space, time and causality vanish in our dreams. Our attention directs where we go next in a dream – not our physical senses and physical bodies (which are deactivated when we are dreaming).\n\nWhy do humans privately dream at all? What’s the point of private dreaming? Well, for one thing, it’s the ultimate simulator. We can have hyper-realistic dreams that simulate the most awful, and also the most pleasurable, things. We can rehearse public life in our private dreams. Also, it’s the ultimate downtime. We can leave all the worries, pressures and frustrations of the shared environment behind. Above all, it’s where we can experience our numinous Higher Self, albeit through the filter of the unconscious.\n\nIf you want to know what death is like, well, you already know! In death, you simply enter an enhanced dream state. Part of that dream state is something very real and very serious: it concerns how you negotiate your reincarnation. Most people have no idea what’s going on, so are simply swept along by the “dream current”, and end up in any old body. Those who have been correctly trained, know exactly what’s happening and can exercise immense mathematical control over the process ... and insert themselves into exactly the body and life they want.﻿"}

You can still chew the bark, but why would you? I just go to the store and buy ibuprofen like a normal person, but I'd to still remember that willow bark for a headache works and not be called a lunatic. \n\nI believe you can fix a lot of stuff at home without prescriptions, and I don't like when people call out anything that's not FDA approved. The reason it's not approved is usually because no ones bothering, or the effect is minimal. Like ear candles to remove ear wax.\n\nI feel when most people think of homeopathy they're thinking the extreme like anti vaccination mothers trying to cure their child with essential oils and chicken noodle soup, and that's not what homeopathy is about, even people who are able to fix stuff at home go to the doctor and take prescriptions for things that the natural cure is too complicated or that an economy of scale makes possible. Imagine buying a horse or a pig to raise so you can harvest insulin secretions from, it doesn't make any sense to do that when you could just buy a bottle of bacteria synthesized insulin at the pharmacy and not spend your life raising those animals you can't butcher.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "UgxgrzbHXVA2tsABHIJ4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Life is energy. Life is information. Life is mathematics. To be alive, you must be: \n1) an uncreated, immortal, indestructible system of energy and information, i.e. a soul.\n2) a self-contained system dependent on nothing else for its existence, i.e. a substance.\n3) an entity capable of receiving, experiencing, interpreting and generating information, i.e. a subject.\n4) a purely mathematical entity (since energy and information are essential to life, and energy and information are purely mathematical), i.e. a monad.\n5) an immaterial, dimensionless, frequency domain outside space and time, i.e. a Fourier point. \n6) an independent causal agent that can initiate its own causal chains, i.e. a prime mover (anuncaused cause).\n7) an entity with an inbuilt drive to optimise itself, i.e. to exhibit Will to Power. An entity that wishes to convert all of its potential into actualisation, i.e. an entelechy.\n9) an entity seeking meaning, i.e. exhibiting a Will to Meaning.\n10) A teleological entity, aiming to attain a maximum state of power and optimisation, i.e. to reach an omega point. An artificial intelligence – a robot, android, replicant, or computer – can never be alive because anything manmade can never be a soul, substance, subject, monad, point, prime mover, and entelechy with a Will to Power, a Will to Meaning, and converging on an omega point. To put it in a nutshell, life consists of dynamic, self-solving mathematical systems. Mathematics is not a dreary, abstract process carried out on paper. It’s a living, ontological, dialectical process going on everywhere all the time. Self-solving, self-optimising mathematical processes are built into the fabric of the cosmos. We consciously sit down to solve mathematical problems. In nature, monads are continuously, unconsciously, engaged in solving themselves. What is the answer a monad is looking for? – the subjective feeling of optimised power, i.e. the feeling that one is God! This is reflected objectively in terms of perfect mathematical symmetry, such symmetry being associated with perfect thinking, knowing and understanding. It doesn’t matter what you believe you are. What you actually are is an eternal mathematical system compulsively driven to find the optimal solution to itself ... to attain divinity. Why are human beings – apart from autistic scientists and atheists – so drawn to the concepts of God, divinity and perfection? It’s because we instinctively know that this is exactly the answer we are seeking to our own equation. Descartes said that humans know they are imperfect, yet find in their minds an idea of supreme perfection. He concluded that this idea corresponded to an actual being external to us – God. In fact, “God” is the perfect omega point that we are seeking to attain for ourselves. We are irresistibly compelled to become God, and we won’t stop until we have. It’s all in the math. Even atheistic scientists have their version of God and perfection – a final scientific theory of everything (except it will be nothing of the kind since science by its nature can never deliver any kind of finality). At the end of every question, mathematics stands as the answer. The universe, and everything in it, is just one vast, cosmic, mathematical, self-solving, self-optimising organism. When does it know it has reached the final answer? When it knows itself as perfection ... when it knows itself as God. The universe has reached its omega point when it has attained God consciousness. Each of us can do this on an individual basis via individual gnosis and enlightenment, but the universe produces its final answer only when every soul in existence has become God. Hegel presented this same vision. Not in directly mathematical terms, but, rather, as the dialectical, rational progress of cosmic mind/spirit (Geist) towards self-consciousness, towards the Absolute. Existence has nothing to do with Creationism. It’s all about Evolution. The universe is an evolutionary life form converting its own potential into actualisation. This process is defined by a key phase transition: from unconsciousness to consciousness. A species can undergo incredibly fast evolution once it has become conscious of what it really is. It can then rationally plan how to optimise itself. That’s why it’s so important that mainstream religion and scientific materialism are swept aside. Humanity, as a whole, can become divine, and in just a few generations ... but only by everyone becoming an Illuminist, only by ontological mathematics replacing scientific materialism, only by humanity’s greatest geniuses unlocking the full power of the God Equation, Fourier mathematics and holography. We are holographic beings in a self-generating holographic universe. We inhabit a cosmic hologram – a living organism – that wishes to transform itself into God, residing in paradise. Let’s get it done. What are we waiting for?﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "UgzvFeAkxln3F3ZiyRZ4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "The Birth of Consciousness\n\nCounsciousness arose precisely because of the inverse Fourier transform. We could not be conscious without it. Consciousness is a wholly mathematical phenomenon. It arose from the switch from a dominant non-local mode of mind to a dominant local mode. Once we had this local mode, we could clearly distinguish ourselves from each other. Prior to that, we were so interconnected that we could not easily act as individuals (just as ants and bees can’t). We tended to act in terms of the Monadic Collective, i.e. machinelike, or like ants or bees in their colonies. When people are hypnotized, they are docile and lacking personality and individuality. They become an extension of the dominant hypnotist’s mind. In the bicameral period, everyone was like this – all waiting to be directed by the voices of “the gods”. As people started to become conscious (separate rather than interconnected), they simultaneously started to become selfish, aggressive and violent, keen to dominate others. Thus we entered the Age of War, of Male rule, in which the most psychopathic men rose to the top. The world has been ruled by male psychopaths ever since. Psychopathy is a kind of ultra individuation whereby a person has no sense of connection with other people at all. He exists purely for himself. Anarcho- capitalist libertarians are high on the psychopathy spectrum. All right wing ideologies reflect psychopathic tendencies. As individualism becomes too extreme, it always kills sympathy and positive empathy towards others. Autism also reflects complete individualism, isolating the sufferer from everyone else. Autistics have no intuition, little or no empathy or sympathy, can’t tell lies, can’t fall in love, and are locked into their own world. They experience sensory overload – meaning they are victims of “hyperlocalism”. They are carrying out an extreme degree of inverse Fourier transform processing, producing far too much detail and intensity. Consciousness is the byproduct of a mind that has achieved a localist, individuated view of reality. If we over-identify with our conscious, we become strangers to our soul. If we over-identify with our unconscious, we become strangers to our body (and turn into body and even mind renouncers, like the Buddhists). Left brain dominants are too connected with the body and not enough with the soul. Right brain dominants are too disconnected from the body, but this gives them a much better chance of achieving enlightenment, or, certainly, different states of consciousness. Enlightenment religions often push an outright anti-body agenda. However, true enlightenment means you should not despise your body (the physical vehicle of your soul) any more than you should your car (the physical vehicle for your body). You should gain absolute understanding and mastery of the physical world before you choose to leave it. Otherwise, you’ll be coming straight back because you haven’t outgrown it yet. Thinking is a left brain characteristic while feeling is a right brain characteristic. Sensing is the defining left brain characteristic (preceding thinking), while intuition is the defining right brain characteristic (preceding feeling). Therefore our world is a battleground for sensing types versus intuitives. Sensing and intuition are about data collection, while thinking and feelings are about data evaluation. Humanity began as data collectors, and only slowly acquired the means to evaluate data.﻿"}

I thought, \"Perhaps I should go back and watch it again with a more critical and objective, if possible, eye.\"\n\nThen came the \"Truth is, the frogs..\" bit....after that, your argument lost me. \nThe value I assigned to your reasoning began to leak...  What happened?﻿"}

Atheism isn’t just about denying the existence of the genocidal, child murdering, partisan, evil, and insane war god of Abrahamism. No. Atheism irrationally denies the existence of ANY designer for the universe, even if that designer isn’t a ridiculous all powerful psychopath in the sky, but a living system of pure and eternal hyperrational mathematics with design inherently built into it. Atheism denies reason. It denies that there is a purpose to the universe. It says that humanity is a random accident created by the random collisions of microscopic balls of matter, which it calls “atoms” or “particles”. It says that when a human being dies, they are wiped out of existence since their mind was just a contingent, random act of pointless matter.\n\nAtheism, in effect, says that there is no point, purpose or meaning to life, hence morality is pointless and false, altruism is pointless and false, goodness is pointless and false, caring about others is pointless and false, working to improve yourself is pointless and false, working to improve the world is pointless and false, and doing anything for any reason other than the instant gratification of yourself via your sense experiences is pointless and false since, according to atheistic thinking, everything is just going to end in entropy and universal “heat death”.

Therefore, existence has always existed: it’s eternal. Nothing eternal can be contingent or dependent in any way. So, what are the only things in the universe that are completely removed from contingency and dependency? They are the truths of reason: the laws of mathematics, encoded in eternal mathematical systems (monadic minds). Mathematics is eternal and nothing else is – hence mathematics is the source of everything else, of all contingent and dependent things. Mathematics is the first cause, the uncaused cause, the uncreated cause, the eternal cause, the Prime Mover – equivalent to what Aristotle called “God”. However, it does not come as a single entity but as a myriad of entities – living, ontological mathematical minds (monads). Each monad is a self-contained, perfect, eternal and indestructible mathematical system: an immortal soul. Souls are the carriers of mathematics. In Leibniz’s published Monadology, “God” created the monads and programmed each and every one of them to ensure the “best of all possible worlds” – the only universe that a perfect God could logically create. All monads were “windowless”: none of them interacted with each other, but only appeared to interact, in accordance with God’s “pre- established harmony”. In Leibniz’s unpublished Monadology, there’s no Creator God. Monads themselves replace God as the eternal, uncreated, uncaused first causes from which everything else flows. As self-actualising, self-optimising entities, their task is to give rise to the best of all possible worlds: paradise, where all monads become Gods. All monads are “windowed” and interact with each other in accordance with the laws of mathematics, inbuilt in every monad. Mathematics is the common language of monads; and each monad is a fundamental unit of living, ontological mathematics. What could be simpler?﻿"}

In science, irrationalist randomness is the ground of matter, and matter is the ground of mind. Well, which version will you choose? Are you a rationalist or an irrationalist, an ontological mathematician or a scientist? Illuminism totally rejects all irrational, random, “magical” explanations of reality, hence totally repudiates science. Science is a silly philosophy that has abandoned reason in order to embrace causeless randomness. It’s driven to do so by an absolute hatred of any suggestion that mind precedes matter, which would destroy the scientific paradigm and necessitate the ultimate paradigm shift. Science prefers non-mental randomness to mental (mathematical) rationalism. If you prefer science to ontological mathematics, it says everything that needs to be said about your respect (or lack thereof) for reason. If you’re a scientist, you’re an irrationalist. That’s a fact. You have turned to randomness rather than reason to explain existence, but, of course, randomness can’t explain anything at all. It’s no different from magic, i.e. things happen for no rational reason, and can’t be explained. It’s no wonder that the scientific universe is meaningless, pointless, aimless and purposeless since any universe grounded in irrational randomness can’t be anything other than those things. No rational arguments compelled scientists to arrive at this extraordinary position. Pure irrationalism drove them there. Scientists suffer from a hysterical, fanatical hatred of reason and mind. Therefore, scientists suffer from a hysterical, fanatical hatred of ontological mathematics, in which reason and mind are united. Nothing is more significant about science than its inability to explain what mathematics is ontologically, and what it’s doing at the heart of all scientific theories. Science is a joke that makes no attempt to explain itself. It grandiosely pursues a “theory of everything” while being totally clueless about what mathematics is, and yet the theory of everything is sure to be expressed in hyper-mathematical terms! Science is intellectually offensive. It’s an irrational philosophy that refuses to acknowledge that it’s a philosophy at all, and which openly despises philosophy and refuses to engage with philosophical issues, deeming them “non-scientific”. No scientist would ever dream of addressing our critique of science, which rather tells you everything you need to know about science and its evasion of the big questions. Science, at the ultimate level, can’t explain anything at all. It can’t even define the problem.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugznq5VqZt5YtjBNbR94AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Cause and Effect\n\nDescartes proposed the powerful argument that a cause must contain at least as much reality as its effect. This seems self-evident. After all, how could an effect have more “reality” than what caused it? How could extra reality be added to the effect if it were not present in the cause? That would mean it had appeared by magic, or was caused by something else, in which case the same argument would still apply. By itself, this principle refutes the entire Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this absurd interpretation, an “unreal” wavefunction “collapses” to produce real effects, i.e. effects have more reality than their causes – a logical impossibility. Only an empiricist with absolute contempt for rationalism could ever make effects more real than causes. An effect is empirical. A cause is not. A cause is rational, noumenal and, as David Hume pointed out so devastatingly, cannot be perceived (hence cannot form any part of empirical science). Empiricists simply can’t bring themselves to acknowledge a real, causal, unobservable domain. Nearly every principle associated with quantum mechanics is false, stemming from an obsession with interpreting this subject empirically rather than rationally. Given that causality cannot be perceived (it’s unobservable), is it any surprise that science – based on observables – has finally got rid of it and declared that ultimate reality is instead random, indeterministic and probabilistic? Causation is the supreme “hidden variable”, but “hidden variables” were exactly what the Copenhagen school most strenuously opposed, so, insanely, they renounced causation. Thus they made science perform the most incredible volte-face in intellectual history. Science went from being totally deterministic to totally indeterministic. Why? Because science is empiricist, and the logic of empiricism, as Hume understood, is to deny causation. Causation is a strictly rationalist, metaphysical, and, finally, mathematical concept.\nCause and effect must have exactly the same degree of “reality”. An effect can’t have less reality than its cause, and definitely can’t have more reality, as the science community insists with its ludicrous randomist ideology. A corollary is that random “causes” can have only random “effects”, and so no order could ever appear in such a system, in contradiction of the ideology of modern science in which randomness miraculously produces the deterministic universe we encounter and experience. A rational cause must have a rational effect. A deterministic cause must have a deterministic effect. An irrational cause must have an irrational effect. An indeterministic cause must have an indeterministic effect. A “cause” for which no sufficient reason can be given must have an “effect” for which no sufficient reason can be given. An inexplicable wavefunction collapse (cause), for example, must have an inexplicable wavefunction effect, hence indeterministic wavefunction collapse can play no part in true quantum mechanics, associated with the ordered world we find ourselves in. An indeterministic cause cannot have a deterministic effect, by rational definition. Nor can a deterministic cause have an indeterministic effect. A rational cause cannot have an irrational effect. An irrational cause cannot have a rational effect. Cause and effect must always belong to the same category. Otherwise, a blatant category error applies – as in an indeterministic version of quantum mechanics being proposed as the ground of the classical determinism we encounter in the macroscopic world. To say, as science does, that indeterminism underlies determinism is ridiculous. It’s irrational. Sadly, scientists have an extreme problem with rationality. Philosophically, science increasingly resembles an expression of David Hume’s extreme empiricism and skepticism. Yet, at exactly the same time, science is becoming more and more mathematical, and mathematics is the quintessence of rationalism. There is not a single scientist alive today who attempts to account for why science espouses empiricism (via its scientific method), yet is meaningless without mathematics (rationalism). How can any thinking person endure such a blatant and fatal contradiction? In case you’re not up to speed with the ideology of quantum mechanics, it is claimed that the quantum mechanical wavefunction is completely deterministic, but unreal, and it “collapses” indeterministically to generate observable, empirical reality. If you think this makes any sense, you are not rational. Unreality cannot underpin reality. Determinism cannot be the source of indeterminism. Unreal causes cannot produced real effects. Yet these are exactly the irrational claims made by contemporary scientists. What is the central problem facing science? It’s a purely philosophical issue – how to marry the scientific method (empiricism) with mathematics (rationalism). Scientists, because they are philosophical ignoramuses, have entirely failed to address this issue. The Copenhagen school came up with the crazy formula that mathematics belongs to an unreal order, and the scientific method to a real order. The problem is extremely easily resolved: mathematics is the real order but is metaphysical (noumenal), while science is its phenomenal expression. The true way to understand quantum mechanics is that mathematics is true reality (reality in itself), while the observable world is the appearance of the underlying mathematics. This is the rationalist, deterministic approach to quantum mechanics, which makes mathematics primary and the scientific method secondary. The crazy way to understand quantum mechanics is the one taken by science. Science says that mathematics is unreal and observable reality “real” (not appearance). To put it another way, deterministic quantum mechanics asserts that mathematics is noumenal and the observable world phenomenal (this view is formally metaphysical, idealist and rationalist). Indeterministic quantum mechanics asserts that there’s no such distinction as noumenal versus phenomenal. Only that which can be observed is real, it says, and since anything noumenal cannot be observed, it cannot be real. So, this approach to quantum mechanics denies the metaphysical distinction between noumena (hidden variables) and phenomena (observable variables). However, because science cannot dispense with mathematics, it has to introduce a radically different distinction, namely, reality versus unreality.﻿"}

Why should the obvious conclusion be avoided? The \"real\" world is a dream world — a construct of mental activity — with one quintessential quality that makes it radically different from our normal dreams: it is a COLLECTIVE dreamscape, not singular. All the minds in the universe contribute to this dream. It's a public, not a private dream. We can \"wake up\" from our private dreams, but we can't wake up from the public dream because we are not in control of it, and nor is anyone else, we can, however, die, and then we do leave the dream. However, reincarnation (or shall we call it \"periodic re-insertion into the collective dream\") throws us back in. Reincarnation is nothing more than \"waking up\" but in a brand new body. Not even death affords an escape from the dream! To quote The Eagles' famous song Hotel California, \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\"\nThere is only one exit from the dream: Gnosis (enlightenment). When you finally grasp that your existence has been one long dream, both public and private (waking and sleeping, across many different bodies and lifetimes), you transcend the dream. You become a Dream Master, a God. Like Neo in The Matrix, you can then do whatever you like in the public dream: you have \"super powers\" — in fact, Divine powers. You can choose to stay within the dream, but, to Gods, the normal dream rapidly loses its attraction. The Gods can do something else, they can construct a higher dream, reserved for the highest minds, the Gods can build heaven, and from heaven they can look  in whenever they like on the lower dream: our world. People imagine that they go to such a heaven when they die, they don't. They are reincarnated back into the normal world and they will never get out until they have understood the true nature of reality.\nOne might say that there are only two public dream domains — heaven and hell — and we, sadly, are in hell!\nSouls are not involved in a test of good versus evil, and are not overseen by a supreme arbiter of morality. Wether it be a morally perfect \"God\" or some cosmic force called \"karma\" that ensures that good deeds are rewarded and bad deeds punished. There is no such God and no such karma. Just about the greatest lie of existence is that it's inherently connected with morality. Morality perse has nothing to do with anything. There is no such thing as morality if it is to be understood as an infallible, absolute set of criteria of good and evil. Morality is always about opinions, beliefs, customs, biases and self-interest. \"Morality\" is always a weapon wielded by one group against another out of pure self-interest, hence has nothing to do with what morality is supposed to be (I.e., entirely beyond self-interest). \nThe true test of existence is that of intelligence versus stupidity; knowledge versus ignorance. Heaven is full of the smartest people in the universe, not the nicest or most faithful or obedient or sanctimonious or best at kneeling and groveling, or the best at putting on a show of meekness, mildness and rectitude. Life is a cosmic IQ test and the only people who get \"saved\" are the geniuses! Geniuses are the true Elect, the only people who will get into heaven are the ones who are smart enough to build it!﻿"}

Physical death is not mental death. You will possess many different material bodies via reincarnation. In fact, you already have. Countless physical lives already lie behind you. Each body dies, but you go on. Every soul is an infinite frequency domain. A frequency domain can do something remarkable. Via the inverse Fourier Transform, it can create spacetime representations of frequency functions. In other words, a soul – simply by thinking mathematically and converting frequency functions into equivalent spacetime functions – can create whole “physical” worlds in its mind. The so-called material world doesn’t exist as anything other than an inverse Fourier Transform. In your dreams, you create your own private world and populate it with anything you like. There are no laws, other than those of Fourier mathematics. You can do whatever you like in your dreams, make anything you like, meet anyone you like, simulate anyone you like. There are no objective laws of space and time, no objective causal laws. You can do anything. You can fly, walk through walls, shrink yourself and expand yourself, make yourself invisible. You name it, you can do it. Your dreams are “proof of concept”. They show that minds – frequency domains – can generate the illusion of physicality. So, why shouldn’t “actual” physicality be a mentally-generated illusion too?\n\n***\n\nPhysicality is inside space and time. Frequency is outside space and time. If you exist as a unitary frequency domain outside space and time then you do not belong to the material world, hence you cannot die in material terms. You really are an eternal being. You can never escape from your existence. You are as old as existence itself, and existence is eternal. You have always existed. You have been with the universe through every step. In your mind is the history of everything that has ever been in the current Cosmic Age. Every secret of the universe is stored in your mind. You yourself have the answers to everything – if you did but know it. The universe consists of nothing but infinite frequency domains – souls! This collection of souls can do something astounding. Rather than always dream individually in complete isolation, the souls can also dream collectively. This is what produces the objective, waking world that we all share. The waking world is an objective, collective dreamworld, while the sleeping world is a subjective, individual dreamworld. That’s the only difference. Both obey Fourier mathematics. When we go to sleep, we leave the public reality and enter the private reality. When we awake, we leave the private reality and re-enter the public reality. We are always dreaming, individually or collectively. When we “die”, our current body leaves the collective dreamworld permanently, and we can only re-enter the collective dreamworld by being reborn via reincarnation. In other words, reincarnation is about the periodic reinsertion of ourselves into the collective dream, via the acquisition of new “dream bodies”.\n\nEach mind can generate its own private “material” worlds in its own individual dreams, but all of the minds working together can also generate a public material world in their collective dream. This public material world of the collective dream is extremely different from the private material world of private dreams. It has fixed laws of spacetime, of mass and energy, of gravity, and so on. In other words, the public material world is the place of objective laws of science. No human mind can overturn these public laws. They are binding on everyone. Every other mind resists you in the public world, whereas no mind resists you in your private world. That’s what differentiates these worlds and gives them their distinctive character. In your private dreamworld, your will is the only will present. In the public dreamworld, all wills are present ... you are up against the will of every other living monad. Your will is being resisted. The Freudian Id acts as though it’s the only will (i.e. it lives in a fantasy world). The Freudian Superego is acutely aware of all other wills (i.e. it lives in a moral world). The Freudian Ego mediates between the Id and Superego via the reality principle (i.e. it lives in the real world). The private material world of individual dreams is based on internally generated coordinates. Everything takes place within the individual soul and has no connection with any other soul. A soul in these conditions is “windowless”. It’s hermetically sealed. The public material world of the collective dream is based on collectively generated Cartesian coordinates. Every monad is assigned unique coordinates in this collective Cartesian arena, this perfect coordinate grid. When all of the minds together perform their usual inverse Fourier transforms – but now directed at a collective mathematical arena rather than individual mathematical arena – they thereby generate what we know as the material world, which science then foolishly concludes is independent of us, rather than created by all of our minds working together. The “matter” that scientists believe in is simply the collective, objective product of minds working in mathematical concert. It has no reality in the absence of minds, contrary to what scientists claim. Scientists are mathematically and philosophically illiterate, which is why they are materialists rather than idealists. Has any scientist ever mathematically explained dreams and how dream worlds can so closely resemble the “real” world? Clearly, dreams must be using the same basic mathematical techniques, but without generating any objective “matter”. The collective inverse Fourier Transform processing of infinite minds is in fact none other than the basis of quantum mechanics! All of the minds together calculate the evolution of the cosmic wavefunction that generates our collective physical reality.﻿"}

The universe consists of nothing but ONE POINT. The whole of existence unfolds within this one point – the Alpha, the Aleph, the “One”. All of mental existence, all of physical existence: it all takes place within just one point. That’s all that existence is – a single point. Of course, it’s a mathematical single point and that means that it can contain infinite other mathematical points. Although there’s an infinite array of points, they’re all still contained within a point. All of these points contain infinite numbers, which all cancel to zero because of positive/negative balance. Although the infinite array of points creates a Cartesian arena in which the events of the physical world take place, this, if understood properly, is all still taking place within a single point – the Existential Singularity. When monads are assigned unique coordinates, they do not physically move to occupy that location. There’s no need. The mere possession of the coordinates is enough. Existence is about mathematical relations, and nothing besides. In the sense that nothing ever leaves the Singularity (the “One”), nothing actually moves at all. Parmenides was right all along that movement in any physical sense is impossible. Movement is a perfect mathematical illusion. In this sense, existence is eternal being. Yet, within the illusion, Heraclitus is right. The universe is nothing but eternal energy, eternal activity, eternal becoming. Yet this becoming is all mental, taking place within a static Singularity. There is no physical universe at all, no infinite expanse of space, no physical movement of any kind. Existence is wholly mental. Movement is mental. The infinite universe is solely mental. All movement takes place mentally – as thinking. The whole “physical” world is just a fantastic mental illusion, but one that is entirely objective. Reality all unfolds within a Singularity. Nothing ever escapes the Singularity. Existence is one point and one point alone. But it is a point that contains infinity in numerous different ways. The Singularity, at other level, is perpetually ZERO. It never deviates from zero. Zero is always conserved no matter what. The universe is literally composed of nothing at all. It has zero energy. The whole of existence – thanks to perfect symmetry – is both everything and nothing. As long as positive infinity cancels negative infinity, it’s possible for existence to be eternally nothing. In the Singularity, something and nothing come together perfectly – mathematically. That’s the only way something and nothing can coexist. That’s the only way everything and nothing can coexist. Leibniz asked why there was something rather than nothing and his final astounding answer was that there was neither something nor nothing, but both. They were inextricably linked by the properties of mathematics. They always coexist. They are indissoluble, just as zero and infinity cannot be found apart. In fact, zero and infinity stand for nothing and everything. We are all zeros living in a universe of zero, a zero Singularity, a zero-energy universe that requires no work to be done to it in order to operate it. It’s the ultimate perpetual motion machine because a) it uses zero energy b) it isn’t physically moving at all and c) its mental movement cancels to zero. The universe requires no energy, no effort to make it happen, no act of Creation. It exists because it requires nothing. It has the lowest possible energy state – zero. It can’t perish because it’s a single dimensionless point with no physical existence. Since it uses zero overall energy, it endures forever. It is self-powering, self-propelling, eternal. It is pure mental activity. It is both subjective and objective. It’s the objective aspect that constitutes what we experience as physical existence, and the subjective aspect is what we experience as mental experience. It is noumenon and phenomenon. It is inside space and time and outside space and time. All thanks to mathematics. Mathematics explains absolutely everything about existence. There are no mysteries at all to a mind that understands the whole of mathematics. Mathematics allows all of the paradoxes that have befuddled the human mind for millennia to be explained – because all of these paradoxes are contained in the properties of numbers. They are integral to the laws of mathematics. Leibniz died before he could fully grasp the significance of the new form of logic that was coming into view whereby two apparently opposite states could coexist. It was Hegel, with his dialectical logic – based on the reconciliation of opposites at higher and higher levels in a dialectical loop of thesis, antithesis and synthesis (which then becomes a new thesis) – who more or less completed the Illuminati’s project to know everything. If you read and understand Hegel’s philosophy from the perspective of the Leibnizian Neoplatonist mathematics that we have described, it will change your life. We are all part of an inevitable dialectical journey to perfection, to the Omega Point, the Absolute, the best of all possible worlds. The Alpha Point is also the Omega Point, but at an infinitely higher level of development. The Alpha Point is pure potential, and the Omega Point is pure actualisation. Alpha becomes Omega dialectically. Your soul is zero, and you are surrounded at this precise instant by infinite other zero-souls. You and the whole of “physical” existence are present in a single point. That’s why you can never die. Nothing ever truly dies in this universe. Death is simply transformation from one life to another. It’s never the end of life. The tunnel of light that people describe in Near Death Experiences is about the return to the pleroma, the fullness, the divine light. We don’t deny for an instant that grasping that existence is just a single point of zero energy, comprised of infinite monads (life forces) is the hardest thing you’ll ever have to fathom. But if you approach the problem methodically, from the mathematical standpoint, and you study Eastern religion, Leibniz’s Monadology, Schopenhauer’s Will, Nietzsche’s Will to Power, Hegel’s Geist and quantum mechanics, you will begin to see that they are all saying exactly the same thing in different vocabularies. It’s all about the VOID. The Void contains everything and yet remains Void. The Void is the perfect plenum. Humanity has always intuited the truth of existence but it has never had sophisticated enough mathematics to express it. Leibniz, in his secret writings made available only to the Illuminati, was the genius who cracked it. Leibniz was the last universal genius. He understood perfectly ancient and medieval philosophy, and the modern philosophy of Descartes, Locke and Spinoza. He was a mathematical genius of the very highest order, and he understood the new Newtonian physics and its conceptual flaws perfectly. He was the best placed person to crack the problem of the Grand Unified Theory of Everything and he achieved it. The whole of humanity owes him the most enormous debt. Hegel, not a mathematical specialist, recast Leibniz’s system in a new vocabulary of dialectical evolution. His philosophy is awesome, but frequently he was wrestling with such difficult concepts that he couldn’t express them in an easily comprehensible way, and his philosophy is notorious for its opacity and difficulty. The present series of books (the God Series) is intended to express Leibniz’s and Hegel’s Illuminist ideas with sufficient clarity to bring Illuminism right into the 21st century... and bring about an intellectual revolution! If there’s one thing you have to bear in mind, it is this: mathematics is not abstract, it’s ontological. Once you realise that all the weird things such as zero, infinity, negative numbers and imaginary numbers are ontologically real, and all the mathematical oddities they reflect, on their own and in combination with other numbers, are all ontologically real too, you have seen the true face of reality. When, on pieces of paper, you write equations, draw graphs, plot charts, divide by zero, and whatever else you do mathematically, you must grasp that these same operations can all be done (and are being done) ontologically too. Above all, you must understand that zero is REAL. It’s a real thing that’s really out there. In fact, there are infinite numbers of zeros, and they are all alive.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugw75guApLq3VYQMHu14AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "The universe is nothing but a mathematical formula on a cosmic scale for creating Gods. The universe’s sole purpose is to manufacture Gods. It’s a vast cosmic production line that takes potential and converts it into actualisation. At the end of the universe – the Omega Point – every monad has become God. The universe has attained the condition of the Absolute. It is perfect. It is fully actualised. There is no potential left to be converted. The universe began as infinite blank zeros, and ended as infinite full zeros. And then what happens? The God Universe enjoys its perfection as long as it can, but bliss is not eternal. The process of converting potential to actualisation is in fact the greatest bliss that can be attained. Bliss evaporates when all potential has been optimised. The God Universe then has only one option: Divine Suicide. And so the whole process begins again, and it can never end. This is an infinite system from which there is no escape. Existence can never cease. Zeros – monads, souls – can never be annihilated. They must choose how to handle eternal existence. That is the supreme question. What is the best way to live an eternal life? The universe has given its answer. Had any final, permanent state of the universe been possible and desirable, we would already have attained it since eternity has already preceded this moment. And eternity stretches before us too. The universe has decreed that the greatest pleasure, the maximum bliss, is to forever complete the cosmic journey from maximum potential to maximum actualisation: for “blank zero” to become all numbers between zero and infinity and be transformed into “full zero”. Completing this journey is the cosmic orgasm, and the universe has no interest other than attaining this cosmic orgasm an infinite number of times. Are we humans not driven in exactly the same way? We all want orgasm after orgasm, with the perfect, most attractive partners. Is that not what haunts our imagination, what we long for? Do we ever want it to stop? Do we want one perfect orgasm that will sate our desire for any further orgasms? No! We never want the orgasms to cease. We don’t want a final blissful state. The pursuit – forever – of more and better orgasms defines us. As above, so below. We are orgasm machines and God machines combined. And in fact becoming God is the greatest orgasm of all. We can’t get enough of it. And we keep repeating this orgasmic process for eternity. Can anyone imagine a better solution to living forever? We have surely found the optimal solution: infinite orgasms!﻿"}

Brain and mind are different entities in a feedback loop. There are four components in the mind-brain system: \n1) Mind (this is an immaterial mathematical singularity outside space and time in the Fourier frequency domain).\n\n2) Matter (Bodies and brains exist in the Fourier spacetime domain). \n3) The mind-matter communication channel (this involves frequency to spacetime Fourier mathematics, i.e. inverse Fourier transforms).\n\n4) The matter-mind communication channel (the return path … this involves spacetime to frequency Fourier mathematics, i.e. forward Fourier transforms).\nWorshipers of scientism say, \"Physical damage to the brain affects the mind, hence the mind is the brain.\" This is the pathetic anti-logic we encounter so often from dogmatic, ideological scientists. Naturally, any physical brain change directly affects elements 2), 3) and 4) in the tetradic system we have described, hence inevitably affects the ability of the mind to interact with the physical world. The mind itself is not damaged by any injury to the brain, but, of course, its means of interacting with the physical world is damaged, hence there will be a radical change in behavior. Smashing your TV set with a sledgehammer will drastically affect your reception of a TV broadcast, but has no effect at all on the broadcast. What could be more obvious? Why are scientists so dumb? They suffer from a staggering lack of imagination and intuition, to such a radical extent that they themselves must be brain damaged. They are unquestionably on the autistic spectrum, which prevents them from escaping their mania with sensory things. They literally are so immersed in sensory data that they cannot conceive of anything that stands outside the sensory world. The problem is with them and their fallacious logic, not with reality.﻿"}

If you think about it, that explains why the human race is so stupid! That’s why reason is in such short supply. Billions of people were literally irrational beasts not so long ago. As for people who keep pets, well they’re keeping in touch with their old mates, aren’t they? They’re reliving the good old days when they were animals rather than humans. Nearly all Muslims and Jews were dogs in their previous lives, which is why they are so desperate for a harsh master (“God”), and so aggressive at defending their master.

That immediately means that you must be in the mathematical game. If you cannot provide a precise definition and formula then you must humbly admit that you simply don’t know, and stop pretending to gullible people that you do. We are of course addressing all of the “gurus” and “prophets” of the world, trying to sucker vulnerable minds into their toxic, self-serving belief systems (invariably designed to make them rich and powerful). With Illuminism, you are not required to believe anything at all. What we say is either rational or irrational. If it’s irrational, it’s junk. If it’s rational – by which we mean it reflects eternal truths of reason – then it’s incontestable, infallible and constitutes absolute knowledge. Only reason, when applied strictly to the eternal truths of reason, never errs, never lies, never deceives. Only ontological mathematics offers certainty. That’s a fact. Either you accept ontological mathematics as the answer to everything, with all that this implies, or you turn to faith, mysticism, irrationalism, accident, chance, randomness, miracles, magic and mystery. Well, what’s it to be? Are you rational or not?\n\nInformation\n\nTo all the “gurus” who imagine they know what existence is, we ask, What is existence made of?; What is life made of?; What is mind made of?; What is free will made of?; What is a thought made of?; What is a feeling made of?; What is an intuition made of?; What is a sensation made of?; What is desire made of?; What is will made of?; What is love made of?; What is the unconscious made of?; What is consciousness made of? After all, they must be made of something. Even fantasies, hallucination, errors, fallacies, beliefs and opinions are made of something. Everything is made of something. What is that something? That’s the fundamental question of existence. There can be only one answer: everything is made of mathematical sinusoids, the perfect carriers of information that give rise to a universe of information. There is not a single thing in the universe that is not concerned with information. It doesn’t have to be accurate or true information, but it certainly has to be information.\n\nAll of your feelings, thoughts, dreams, aspirations, desires, fears, hopes, prayers, loves and hates are all information. There are those who say that mathematics destroys the “poetry” of life. Yet, of course, poetry is also nothing but information! It’s mathematics that creates poetry. Mathematics destroys nothing. Mathematics makes everything possible. Given time, it will even make you God.﻿"}

In fact, existence, as a living entity, can have only one ... to explain itself to itself, to know and understand itself, to know why and how. Only Gods can answer that, hence existence produces Gods in order to provide the answer to itself. \nExistence is ontological reason (mathematics). The supreme task of reason is to give the reason for its own existence. The dialectic is all about existence finding the answer to itself. Existence is an answering machine – an answering life force – answering itself. Existence is the life force answering its own question – what, why and how am I? Existence is reason reasoning out what, why and how it is. Science is interested only in how, hence can never explain why.﻿"}

Not all youtube channels or even websites provide information as well reserched as they should be. Therefor it is crucial to get a second oppinion on the toppic so one does not end up with wrong facts and think of them as the truth... It is really great how you reserch the information you present in your videos, and i enjoy every one of them. But it sometimes is hard to tell apard quality content and bad content. We are all just humans and make mistakes, we sometimes think about a topic in a completely subjectiv way and are sure to got it right, and months later we see the other views on the topic and question everything we said about it. I would recommend everyone to always(!) get at least a second source of information for those topics that are worthy to discuss, before starting a conversation about them. Only this way we spread wrong information or completely subjective views as few as possible. Nontheless i love your honesty about the way your videos are produced and appreciate the quality and effort you put into them to get everything right. I for sure will be with you for the next years to come . :)﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugwtuod-VfdPgQZ7E3l4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Thought\n\nOnly Illuminism has ontologically defined a thought in itself: a thought is a sinusoidal wave. The wave (thought) has both Form and Content. Its Form is its rational, mathematical aspect, while its Content is how that sinusoid is subjectively experienced by a mind. The thought is experienced as anything other than Form. That’s why humanity has been caught between two clashing philosophies: rationalism and empiricism. Rationalism is about Form while empiricism is about Content.\n\nScience is a hybrid system – a muddled compromise – that relies on empirical observations matched to rational mathematical functions. This is a trial-and-error system, entirely lacking in analytic necessity. Therefore, science, for all of its apparent success in describing the observable world of appearances, is 100% useless in telling us about ultimate reality: the noumenal world beyond appearances.\n\nYou cannot base the meaning of life on science since it tells you zero about what reality actually is. Above all, it doesn’t tell you what mind, life and consciousness are – the things most fundamental to any human being, and the things that define the meaning and purpose of our existence. Science, of course, denies that existence has any meaning or purpose.\n\nIn ontological mathematics, metaphysical points and (ontological) mathematical points are one and the same. Leibniz was unable to say what a monad actually comprised in order to allow it to think. He regarded monads as inherently thinking entities, of the type Descartes had suggested, i.e. all unextended substance is thinking substance. However, he couldn’t state what a thought is ontologically. Modern Illuminism has rectified this inadequacy. A monad is a mathematical-metaphysical point, made of a complete and consistent set of sinusoidal waves. Each sinusoid is an individual thought (in itself). Each such thought has both Form and Content. i.e. a rational and empirical aspect. All thoughts are both quantia and qualia.\n\nA mind experiencing a thought never experiences it as pure Form, pure rationalism, pure quantity. It is always experienced in terms of Content, empiricism and qualia. We experience thoughts in terms of feelings, desires, will, sensations, intuitions and practical reason. Only when we engage in thinking about mathematics itself do we start to align our thinking with Form, rationalism, quantity and logic. Reason – theoretical reason – concerns pure, analytic reason. We are at our least human – and yet most in contact with the fundamental nature and language of existence – when we are considering mathematics. Nothing is further from the human condition as an experience than mathematics. Mathematics defines the form, the ontology, of human existence, but we do not experience human existence mathematically. We do not experience the information carrier, only the information carried. We live experientially in a world of phenomena, not noumena.﻿"}

When I was studying one of my Msc (in aquaculture), I took part in a pilot study about this particular topic, and although it is true that they are (in a nutshell) kind of bad for the body, they are actually pretty much not enough researched. Actually... the study I took part in, was around the possibility of senescent cells improving the regeneration capacity of zebrafish after an amputation, and it seemed that senescent cells had quite some relation with regeneration. I'm not saying that your video was MISTAKEN, but you painted those cells as if they were Stalin mixed up with Darth Vader, and that is simply going too far away.\n\nSo... what I'm trying to say is that your videos are a very good approximation to reality, but they should not be taken as a bible.

Sure, you'll eventually arrive at the same answer, but you'll have gained a much better understanding of the underlying concept if you did the calculation yourself. Or, to take a more cliché example; you'll experience a lot more of the world if you just enjoy the journey instead of focusing only on the destination.\n\nAnd this, if I understand correctly, is what Kurzgesagt tries to do. They aren't just giving us answers; they are giving us perspectives that allow us to ask deeper questions.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugy1w-VXWT_xSIT9VeB4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "The “physical” universe is simply a low energy expression of mind with the interesting property that it provides a shared environment of mental energy, hence permits a public, objective mental experience rather than a private, subjective mental experience.\n\nWhen we go to sleep and dream, we sever the link to the public arena and enter our private arena. When we awaken, we re-enter “reality” – the public space.\n\nWe are always dreaming, except sometimes we are dreaming singly and at the other times we are dreaming collectively.\n\nThe material world is not there as anything other than a shared product of the contents of our minds. It’s wholly dependent on mind and has no independent reality. It’s a “scientific” arena because it operates according to the single language that all monads understand: mathematics.\n\nThe mathematics that applies to the shared universe are extremely rigid, predictable and objective. However, when we dream privately, we are no longer subject to these objective rules, which is why space, time and causality vanish in our dreams. Our attention directs where we go next in a dream – not our physical senses and physical bodies (which are deactivated when we are dreaming).\n\nWhy do humans privately dream at all? What’s the point of private dreaming? Well, for one thing, it’s the ultimate simulator. We can have hyper-realistic dreams that simulate the most awful, and also the most pleasurable, things. We can rehearse public life in our private dreams. Also, it’s the ultimate downtime. We can leave all the worries, pressures and frustrations of the shared environment behind. Above all, it’s where we can experience our numinous Higher Self, albeit through the filter of the unconscious.\n\nIf you want to know what death is like, well, you already know! In death, you simply enter an enhanced dream state. Part of that dream state is something very real and very serious: it concerns how you negotiate your reincarnation. Most people have no idea what’s going on, so are simply swept along by the “dream current”, and end up in any old body. Those who have been correctly trained, know exactly what’s happening and can exercise immense mathematical control over the process ... and insert themselves into exactly the body and life they want.﻿"}

Physical death is not mental death. You will possess many different material bodies via reincarnation. In fact, you already have. Countless physical lives already lie behind you. Each body dies, but you go on. Every soul is an infinite frequency domain. A frequency domain can do something remarkable. Via the inverse Fourier Transform, it can create spacetime representations of frequency functions. In other words, a soul – simply by thinking mathematically and converting frequency functions into equivalent spacetime functions – can create whole “physical” worlds in its mind. The so-called material world doesn’t exist as anything other than an inverse Fourier Transform. In your dreams, you create your own private world and populate it with anything you like. There are no laws, other than those of Fourier mathematics. You can do whatever you like in your dreams, make anything you like, meet anyone you like, simulate anyone you like. There are no objective laws of space and time, no objective causal laws. You can do anything. You can fly, walk through walls, shrink yourself and expand yourself, make yourself invisible. You name it, you can do it. Your dreams are “proof of concept”. They show that minds – frequency domains – can generate the illusion of physicality. So, why shouldn’t “actual” physicality be a mentally-generated illusion too?\n\n***\n\nPhysicality is inside space and time. Frequency is outside space and time. If you exist as a unitary frequency domain outside space and time then you do not belong to the material world, hence you cannot die in material terms. You really are an eternal being. You can never escape from your existence. You are as old as existence itself, and existence is eternal. You have always existed. You have been with the universe through every step. In your mind is the history of everything that has ever been in the current Cosmic Age. Every secret of the universe is stored in your mind. You yourself have the answers to everything – if you did but know it. The universe consists of nothing but infinite frequency domains – souls! This collection of souls can do something astounding. Rather than always dream individually in complete isolation, the souls can also dream collectively. This is what produces the objective, waking world that we all share. The waking world is an objective, collective dreamworld, while the sleeping world is a subjective, individual dreamworld. That’s the only difference. Both obey Fourier mathematics. When we go to sleep, we leave the public reality and enter the private reality. When we awake, we leave the private reality and re-enter the public reality. We are always dreaming, individually or collectively. When we “die”, our current body leaves the collective dreamworld permanently, and we can only re-enter the collective dreamworld by being reborn via reincarnation. In other words, reincarnation is about the periodic reinsertion of ourselves into the collective dream, via the acquisition of new “dream bodies”.\n\nEach mind can generate its own private “material” worlds in its own individual dreams, but all of the minds working together can also generate a public material world in their collective dream. This public material world of the collective dream is extremely different from the private material world of private dreams. It has fixed laws of spacetime, of mass and energy, of gravity, and so on. In other words, the public material world is the place of objective laws of science. No human mind can overturn these public laws. They are binding on everyone. Every other mind resists you in the public world, whereas no mind resists you in your private world. That’s what differentiates these worlds and gives them their distinctive character. In your private dreamworld, your will is the only will present. In the public dreamworld, all wills are present ... you are up against the will of every other living monad. Your will is being resisted. The Freudian Id acts as though it’s the only will (i.e. it lives in a fantasy world). The Freudian Superego is acutely aware of all other wills (i.e. it lives in a moral world). The Freudian Ego mediates between the Id and Superego via the reality principle (i.e. it lives in the real world). The private material world of individual dreams is based on internally generated coordinates. Everything takes place within the individual soul and has no connection with any other soul. A soul in these conditions is “windowless”. It’s hermetically sealed. The public material world of the collective dream is based on collectively generated Cartesian coordinates. Every monad is assigned unique coordinates in this collective Cartesian arena, this perfect coordinate grid. When all of the minds together perform their usual inverse Fourier transforms – but now directed at a collective mathematical arena rather than individual mathematical arena – they thereby generate what we know as the material world, which science then foolishly concludes is independent of us, rather than created by all of our minds working together. The “matter” that scientists believe in is simply the collective, objective product of minds working in mathematical concert. It has no reality in the absence of minds, contrary to what scientists claim. Scientists are mathematically and philosophically illiterate, which is why they are materialists rather than idealists. Has any scientist ever mathematically explained dreams and how dream worlds can so closely resemble the “real” world? Clearly, dreams must be using the same basic mathematical techniques, but without generating any objective “matter”. The collective inverse Fourier Transform processing of infinite minds is in fact none other than the basis of quantum mechanics! All of the minds together calculate the evolution of the cosmic wavefunction that generates our collective physical reality.﻿"}

{"author": "Broly", "cid": "Ugzmr7LtMzuhIJrR1zF4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "Our dreams prove that minds are capable of creating the illusion of matter without a single trace of bona fide matter. Why should the obvious conclusion be avoided? The \"real\" world is a dream world — a construct of mental activity — with one quintessential quality that makes it radically different from our normal dreams: it is a COLLECTIVE dreamscape, not singular. All the minds in the universe contribute to this dream. It's a public, not a private dream. We can \"wake up\" from our private dreams, but we can't wake up from the public dream because we are not in control of it, and nor is anyone else, we can, however, die, and then we do leave the dream. However, reincarnation (or shall we call it \"periodic re-insertion into the collective dream\") throws us back in. Reincarnation is nothing more than \"waking up\" but in a brand new body. Not even death affords an escape from the dream! To quote The Eagles' famous song Hotel California, \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\"\nThere is only one exit from the dream: Gnosis (enlightenment). When you finally grasp that your existence has been one long dream, both public and private (waking and sleeping, across many different bodies and lifetimes), you transcend the dream. You become a Dream Master, a God. Like Neo in The Matrix, you can then do whatever you like in the public dream: you have \"super powers\" — in fact, Divine powers. You can choose to stay within the dream, but, to Gods, the normal dream rapidly loses its attraction. The Gods can do something else, they can construct a higher dream, reserved for the highest minds, the Gods can build heaven, and from heaven they can look  in whenever they like on the lower dream: our world. People imagine that they go to such a heaven when they die, they don't. They are reincarnated back into the normal world and they will never get out until they have understood the true nature of reality.\nOne might say that there are only two public dream domains — heaven and hell — and we, sadly, are in hell!\nSouls are not involved in a test of good versus evil, and are not overseen by a supreme arbiter of morality. Wether it be a morally perfect \"God\" or some cosmic force called \"karma\" that ensures that good deeds are rewarded and bad deeds punished. There is no such God and no such karma. Just about the greatest lie of existence is that it's inherently connected with morality. Morality perse has nothing to do with anything. There is no such thing as morality if it is to be understood as an infallible, absolute set of criteria of good and evil. Morality is always about opinions, beliefs, customs, biases and self-interest. \"Morality\" is always a weapon wielded by one group against another out of pure self-interest, hence has nothing to do with what morality is supposed to be (I.e., entirely beyond self-interest). \nThe true test of existence is that of intelligence versus stupidity; knowledge versus ignorance. Heaven is full of the smartest people in the universe, not the nicest or most faithful or obedient or sanctimonious or best at kneeling and groveling, or the best at putting on a show of meekness, mildness and rectitude. Life is a cosmic IQ test and the only people who get \"saved\" are the geniuses! Geniuses are the true Elect, the only people who will get into heaven are the ones who are smart enough to build it!﻿"}

It provided me with perspective on the matter, that I wasn't getting from traditional media. I subsequently showed the video to many others to help them form a less isolationist opinion.\n\nThat being said, I fully understand the decision of taking it down. The video didn't really do enough to show the other side of the issue and quickly dismissed any contradictory arguments. It wasn't wrong, it just didn't show the whole picture for the sake of fairness.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to your more recent videos, where I've been noticing how carefully you work on addressing any common concerns. The organic food video was a masterpiece of presenting facts with fairness, without deferring to centrism.\n\nYou are probably my favourite channel on YouTube and among the very few I support on Patreon. Keep being awesome. :)﻿"}

And thank you for the introspective in this particular video, even though its not a typical piece, we can all learn a lot from it.﻿"}

We should  compare sources, use our own perception, and think hard before reaching any conclusion. And if there is still some wrong in our hypothesis, correct ourselves when we get to know it, instead of arguing with blind faith.﻿"}

{"author": "IHazMagics", "cid": "UgzSf4oPDO5qUHQL5vV4AaABAg", "time": "3 hours ago", "text": "While I see the reasoning behind outdated or perhaps “incorrect” videos, deleting them is, in my view, throwing the baby out with the bath water.\n\nThe addictions video certainly did leave a bit to be desired, but to delete it, while talking about its success for the channels comes across as trying to fall on ones sword. The continued process of psychology is an iterative one, it’s only through previous research and sources that got it wrong, can we build on those previous failures.\n\nThe refugee crisis was as you succinctly said, a video created in the zeitgeist of that situation. Removing it because individuals didn’t appreciate it seems to be against what Kuzgesagt is about, or at least my individual interpretation of what it’s about. Facts know no bias, nor do they encompass feelings, they are what they are to put it lightly.\n\nWhile I do appreciate the acknowledgment that no one is perfect, and that there were times were scientific rigours weren’t upheld, removing evidence of that is leaning too far into a potentially idyllic standpoint that the channel is perfect. Without some potential flaws that open this channel up to criticism, which create conversation, which allows all to learn from both the good and the bad. Having a channel that the idea is to be 100% perfect and represent as such is a slippery slope to blind acceptance. No expert is perfectly infallible, and must be wrong to a specific degree, so too should this channel. The difference is, this channel has the unique ability to be candid about being incorrect, to generate a larger conversation, and more research into the topic.\n\nI hope you will reupload those two videos, as their absence is far more detrimental than their prescience, and I hope you will consider why that is. I do hope to see them back, I will continue to watch Kurzgesagt videos regardless, but the experience would be tainted.\n\nMuch the same as currently writing a psychological thesis, if I were to explore previous research and find out its no longer there, I can’t begin to learn why it was wrong, and instead now need to focus on current research that in itself may also be wrong, as it’s removed my ability to research it myself.\n\nIf you read this, thank you, all the work you do is appreciated. The tone of the video is transparent and I appreciate that, but removing those two videos simply because you don’t like them, is perhaps not the best fit for people looking to research those very in depth and involved topics.﻿"}

The reason for that being, particularly because of their popularity, there may be people who had seen them in the past and would direct others to see them, and even though they are not purged from the internet, you will no longer be able to provide context to why you no longer support them or are proud of them and provide new discussion and research.\n\n\nIn short, my thought is, owning your mistakes and short comings is laudable, and it's clear to me that's your intention, I just think the best way to own them is to leave them there in their full context, with all the comments in place, obviously with some clearly marked updates.\n\n\nThat all said, keep up the good work, you're still one of the best science channels on youtube.﻿"}

Why should the obvious conclusion be avoided? The \"real\" world is a dream world — a construct of mental activity — with one quintessential quality that makes it radically different from our normal dreams: it is a COLLECTIVE dreamscape, not singular. All the minds in the universe contribute to this dream. It's a public, not a private dream. We can \"wake up\" from our private dreams, but we can't wake up from the public dream because we are not in control of it, and nor is anyone else, we can, however, die, and then we do leave the dream. However, reincarnation (or shall we call it \"periodic re-insertion into the collective dream\") throws us back in. Reincarnation is nothing more than \"waking up\" but in a brand new body. Not even death affords an escape from the dream! To quote The Eagles' famous song Hotel California, \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\"\nThere is only one exit from the dream: Gnosis (enlightenment). When you finally grasp that your existence has been one long dream, both public and private (waking and sleeping, across many different bodies and lifetimes), you transcend the dream. You become a Dream Master, a God. Like Neo in The Matrix, you can then do whatever you like in the public dream: you have \"super powers\" — in fact, Divine powers. You can choose to stay within the dream, but, to Gods, the normal dream rapidly loses its attraction. The Gods can do something else, they can construct a higher dream, reserved for the highest minds, the Gods can build heaven, and from heaven they can look  in whenever they like on the lower dream: our world. People imagine that they go to such a heaven when they die, they don't. They are reincarnated back into the normal world and they will never get out until they have understood the true nature of reality.\nOne might say that there are only two public dream domains — heaven and hell — and we, sadly, are in hell!\nSouls are not involved in a test of good versus evil, and are not overseen by a supreme arbiter of morality. Wether it be a morally perfect \"God\" or some cosmic force called \"karma\" that ensures that good deeds are rewarded and bad deeds punished. There is no such God and no such karma. Just about the greatest lie of existence is that it's inherently connected with morality. Morality perse has nothing to do with anything. There is no such thing as morality if it is to be understood as an infallible, absolute set of criteria of good and evil. Morality is always about opinions, beliefs, customs, biases and self-interest. \"Morality\" is always a weapon wielded by one group against another out of pure self-interest, hence has nothing to do with what morality is supposed to be (I.e., entirely beyond self-interest). \nThe true test of existence is that of intelligence versus stupidity; knowledge versus ignorance. Heaven is full of the smartest people in the universe, not the nicest or most faithful or obedient or sanctimonious or best at kneeling and groveling, or the best at putting on a show of meekness, mildness and rectitude. Life is a cosmic IQ test and the only people who get \"saved\" are the geniuses! Geniuses are the true Elect, the only people who will get into heaven are the ones who are smart enough to build it!﻿"}

Physical death is not mental death. You will possess many different material bodies via reincarnation. In fact, you already have. Countless physical lives already lie behind you. Each body dies, but you go on. Every soul is an infinite frequency domain. A frequency domain can do something remarkable. Via the inverse Fourier Transform, it can create spacetime representations of frequency functions. In other words, a soul – simply by thinking mathematically and converting frequency functions into equivalent spacetime functions – can create whole “physical” worlds in its mind. The so-called material world doesn’t exist as anything other than an inverse Fourier Transform. In your dreams, you create your own private world and populate it with anything you like. There are no laws, other than those of Fourier mathematics. You can do whatever you like in your dreams, make anything you like, meet anyone you like, simulate anyone you like. There are no objective laws of space and time, no objective causal laws. You can do anything. You can fly, walk through walls, shrink yourself and expand yourself, make yourself invisible. You name it, you can do it. Your dreams are “proof of concept”. They show that minds – frequency domains – can generate the illusion of physicality. So, why shouldn’t “actual” physicality be a mentally-generated illusion too?\n\n***\n\nPhysicality is inside space and time. Frequency is outside space and time. If you exist as a unitary frequency domain outside space and time then you do not belong to the material world, hence you cannot die in material terms. You really are an eternal being. You can never escape from your existence. You are as old as existence itself, and existence is eternal. You have always existed. You have been with the universe through every step. In your mind is the history of everything that has ever been in the current Cosmic Age. Every secret of the universe is stored in your mind. You yourself have the answers to everything – if you did but know it. The universe consists of nothing but infinite frequency domains – souls! This collection of souls can do something astounding. Rather than always dream individually in complete isolation, the souls can also dream collectively. This is what produces the objective, waking world that we all share. The waking world is an objective, collective dreamworld, while the sleeping world is a subjective, individual dreamworld. That’s the only difference. Both obey Fourier mathematics. When we go to sleep, we leave the public reality and enter the private reality. When we awake, we leave the private reality and re-enter the public reality. We are always dreaming, individually or collectively. When we “die”, our current body leaves the collective dreamworld permanently, and we can only re-enter the collective dreamworld by being reborn via reincarnation. In other words, reincarnation is about the periodic reinsertion of ourselves into the collective dream, via the acquisition of new “dream bodies”.\n\nEach mind can generate its own private “material” worlds in its own individual dreams, but all of the minds working together can also generate a public material world in their collective dream. This public material world of the collective dream is extremely different from the private material world of private dreams. It has fixed laws of spacetime, of mass and energy, of gravity, and so on. In other words, the public material world is the place of objective laws of science. No human mind can overturn these public laws. They are binding on everyone. Every other mind resists you in the public world, whereas no mind resists you in your private world. That’s what differentiates these worlds and gives them their distinctive character. In your private dreamworld, your will is the only will present. In the public dreamworld, all wills are present ... you are up against the will of every other living monad. Your will is being resisted. The Freudian Id acts as though it’s the only will (i.e. it lives in a fantasy world). The Freudian Superego is acutely aware of all other wills (i.e. it lives in a moral world). The Freudian Ego mediates between the Id and Superego via the reality principle (i.e. it lives in the real world). The private material world of individual dreams is based on internally generated coordinates. Everything takes place within the individual soul and has no connection with any other soul. A soul in these conditions is “windowless”. It’s hermetically sealed. The public material world of the collective dream is based on collectively generated Cartesian coordinates. Every monad is assigned unique coordinates in this collective Cartesian arena, this perfect coordinate grid. When all of the minds together perform their usual inverse Fourier transforms – but now directed at a collective mathematical arena rather than individual mathematical arena – they thereby generate what we know as the material world, which science then foolishly concludes is independent of us, rather than created by all of our minds working together. The “matter” that scientists believe in is simply the collective, objective product of minds working in mathematical concert. It has no reality in the absence of minds, contrary to what scientists claim. Scientists are mathematically and philosophically illiterate, which is why they are materialists rather than idealists. Has any scientist ever mathematically explained dreams and how dream worlds can so closely resemble the “real” world? Clearly, dreams must be using the same basic mathematical techniques, but without generating any objective “matter”. The collective inverse Fourier Transform processing of infinite minds is in fact none other than the basis of quantum mechanics! All of the minds together calculate the evolution of the cosmic wavefunction that generates our collective physical reality.﻿"}

When we awaken, we re-enter “reality” – the public space.\n\nWe are always dreaming, except sometimes we are dreaming singly and at the other times we are dreaming collectively.\n\nThe material world is not there as anything other than a shared product of the contents of our minds. It’s wholly dependent on mind and has no independent reality. It’s a “scientific” arena because it operates according to the single language that all monads understand: mathematics.\n\nThe mathematics that applies to the shared universe are extremely rigid, predictable and objective. However, when we dream privately, we are no longer subject to these objective rules, which is why space, time and causality vanish in our dreams. Our attention directs where we go next in a dream – not our physical senses and physical bodies (which are deactivated when we are dreaming).\n\nWhy do humans privately dream at all? What’s the point of private dreaming? Well, for one thing, it’s the ultimate simulator. We can have hyper-realistic dreams that simulate the most awful, and also the most pleasurable, things. We can rehearse public life in our private dreams. Also, it’s the ultimate downtime. We can leave all the worries, pressures and frustrations of the shared environment behind. Above all, it’s where we can experience our numinous Higher Self, albeit through the filter of the unconscious.\n\nIf you want to know what death is like, well, you already know! In death, you simply enter an enhanced dream state. Part of that dream state is something very real and very serious: it concerns how you negotiate your reincarnation. Most people have no idea what’s going on, so are simply swept along by the “dream current”, and end up in any old body. Those who have been correctly trained, know exactly what’s happening and can exercise immense mathematical control over the process ... and insert themselves into exactly the body and life they want.﻿"}

That immediately means that you must be in the mathematical game. If you cannot provide a precise definition and formula then you must humbly admit that you simply don’t know, and stop pretending to gullible people that you do. We are of course addressing all of the “gurus” and “prophets” of the world, trying to sucker vulnerable minds into their toxic, self-serving belief systems (invariably designed to make them rich and powerful). With Illuminism, you are not required to believe anything at all. What we say is either rational or irrational. If it’s irrational, it’s junk. If it’s rational – by which we mean it reflects eternal truths of reason – then it’s incontestable, infallible and constitutes absolute knowledge. Only reason, when applied strictly to the eternal truths of reason, never errs, never lies, never deceives. Only ontological mathematics offers certainty. That’s a fact. Either you accept ontological mathematics as the answer to everything, with all that this implies, or you turn to faith, mysticism, irrationalism, accident, chance, randomness, miracles, magic and mystery. Well, what’s it to be? Are you rational or not?\n\nInformation\n\nTo all the “gurus” who imagine they know what existence is, we ask, What is existence made of?; What is life made of?; What is mind made of?; What is free will made of?; What is a thought made of?; What is a feeling made of?; What is an intuition made of?; What is a sensation made of?; What is desire made of?; What is will made of?; What is love made of?; What is the unconscious made of?; What is consciousness made of? After all, they must be made of something. Even fantasies, hallucination, errors, fallacies, beliefs and opinions are made of something. Everything is made of something. What is that something? That’s the fundamental question of existence. There can be only one answer: everything is made of mathematical sinusoids, the perfect carriers of information that give rise to a universe of information. There is not a single thing in the universe that is not concerned with information. It doesn’t have to be accurate or true information, but it certainly has to be information.\n\nAll of your feelings, thoughts, dreams, aspirations, desires, fears, hopes, prayers, loves and hates are all information. There are those who say that mathematics destroys the “poetry” of life. Yet, of course, poetry is also nothing but information! It’s mathematics that creates poetry. Mathematics destroys nothing. Mathematics makes everything possible. Given time, it will even make you God.﻿"}

The problem is, even people who believe evolution is true disassociate themselves from the process. They somehow skipped all the lower forms of animal life and just started out at the top of the evolutionary ladder.\n \nThe evidence says we evolved as life evolved.\n \nHuman beings did not just appear at the top of the evolutionary ladder to reap the benefits of those millions of years of evolution without having to live through it.\n \nIn other words, you were those other animals. Someone had to be them.\n \nYou had to be lower animals to be a human now. You lived as all the different animals in your evolutionary line. You lived through millions of years, and millions of lives and deaths to get where you are now. That's what Darwin's book means.\n \nIn addition to the fossil evidence, the genetic code proves that all animals, including us, evolved from bacteria over the last 700 million years on earth.\n \nIn other words, you were a microbe, an insect, a fish, a dinosaur, an ape...\n \nWhen all of the evidence (100%) says something happened, and there is no evidence (zero) that anything else could have happened, it is the truth beyond a reasonable doubt to honest, rational people.\n \nWe have come a very, very long way, but we have a little further to go. The next and last step in our evolution is learning and accepting the truth of life, and this includes acknowledging our true past.\n \nYou will die physically, but you will be born into a new physical body. Being born happens, or you would not be here now. You were born into this life. It is what we know happens. There is no evidence anything else happens. True or false?\n \nThe \"you only live once\" theory: Many people say that they do not believe in reincarnation; they believe when you die, you're dead. What about fish, clams, horses, bears, flies? People that say you only live once are saying some souls get to live just one life as a worm, and that is it for all of eternity.\n \nOther people believe you are judged by a god after you die. Is the worm judged?\n\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another. Albert Einstein\n \nLike energy, consciousness cannot be created or destroyed.\n \nThis revelation will change your life. Now you know where you come from and what you've been doing for about half a billion years (evolving). The next question is how does life work and what is next, and we can know that too.\n \n2                                             \n \n \n \nPeople are trying to understand the universe independent of consciousness, and it is the most important factor in the equation.\n \nThe universe as it relates to conscious life can be understood now. It is the ultimate truth of life; the truth that will transform mankind and the world.\n \n\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" F(AB) = -F(BA)\n\nPeople do not realize what Isaac Newton's third law of motion really means.\n \nEverything is balanced. Everything physical (matter/energy) goes back and forth in balanced circles, cycles, or the equivalent. Birth- death, old-young, big-small, strong-weak, start-stop, up-down, rich-poor, beginning-end, fast-slow, hot-cold, pain-pleasure, win-lose, day-night, full-empty, high-low, in-out, success-failure, united-divided, give-receive, creation-destruction, on-off, positive-negative, etc.\n \nPositive and negative forces moving in balance are the physical universe.\n \nThere are no exceptions to the laws of nature Newton revealed. They apply to all matter and energy. Human beings are matter and energy, thus you and all humans are governed by the same laws.﻿"}

It's the anti-EU side that generally wants things brought back to a smaller scale in stead of a giant monopoly structure of corporate and corrupt neoliberal career politicians that aim to control the entire continent.\n\nHere's a few obvious arguments against taking in huge amounts of refugees:\n1. It doesn't solve the problem. The more people you take out of the country, the less people are there to fix it. You can't take in their entire population.\n2. We already have systems in place for allowing refugees. Any change that would let in millions more refugees than would otherwise be the case, would mean breaking down the integrity of these systems.\n3. Considering they're coming out of regions that the west is at (proxy) war with, it's an easy way for terrorists to enter the country. This is a real risk that has to be taken into consideration. Leaders acting like it's not a risk at all does not remove the risk, it only makes it seem more likely to get out of hand because they're ignoring it.\n4. Large amounts of low-skill immigration is always a threat to people in low-skill jobs. And any cultural clashes will also happen to poor people. It's very easy to ignore this from a comfortable middle class position, but poor people are vitally aware of this problem and have a valid reason to object.\n5. We have nothing to gain from letting in large amounts of people and giving them our resources. There are only costs and dangers. To get people to agree with this, these concerns need to be addressed. Otherwise the answer will be no. People like you who immediately jump to allegations of \"white nationalism\" are clearly propagandist hate mongers who have no interest in giving the other side a fair chance. These insults give no incentive to join your prestige project and makes the pro-refugee side look all the more suspicious and dangerous.\n\nThat's just the obvious reasons that are the concerns of most people, reasoned from simple common sense. There are several more reasons that require more research than I can dedicate to a youtube comment.﻿"}
